Kirigami is a simple tool to shape and cut text.

## Mixed messages

Email, mailing list threads, Discourse topics, and Discord messages proliferate. They are a great way to communicate, but they can be hard to follow.

Take the example of a Discourse topic. After twenty replies, it can be timeconsuming to read through the entire thread to find the information you need.

Summaries can help with this. Though summaries often lose the context of the original message.

## Time is fluid

Conversations and dialogues are fluid. They evolve over time, and take on new directions as they progress. How do you capture the flow of the conversation, while still keeping the original context?

## Recaps

While recaps of a conversation can be helpful, they are filtered through the lens of the person who wrote them. They may be biased, or miss key details.

## Numerical datasets

We have best practices for an initial view of a numerical dataset.
We run basic statistics, and visualize the data to get a sense of what we are looking at.

What's the equivalent for a dataset of dialogue's text messages?
