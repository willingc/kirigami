# Use case

## discuss.python.org

A very long topic <https://discuss.python.org/t/lock-files-again-but-this-time-w-sdists/46593>

## Estimated read time

Approximately 2.5 hours to read the entire top and join the conversation now. Yes, there are folks that are trying to catch up now.

## A reader's options after 17 days

1. Devote 2.5 hours to read
2. Skim and hope for the key points
3. Ask someone to summarize
4. Try to follow from where the conversation is.

## What would help?

### Discourse AI - Summarization plugin

<https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-ai-summarization/262711> 

Admins can use via `summarization_strategy` site:
```
A collection of open-source models from HuggingFace: bart-large-cnn-samsum, flan-t5-base-samsum, and long-t5-tglobal-base-16384-book-summary.
OpenAI ChatGPT, using either gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4.
Anthropic Claudeâ€™s V1 and V2 models.
```
Discourse didn't find existing models good enough and switched to LLMs

Fairly inflexible at the moment

### Another option Merfield's plugin
