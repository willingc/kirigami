The file format is TOML.\\n\\nThe allowed keys in the file are listed below (all keys are required unless specified as optional). A TOML file with this also written out can be found at https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.spec.toml . Examples of lock files are listed later on.\\n\\nAnything w/ a \\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5 means it\\'s a contentious key.\\n\\n## `meta`\\nMetadata version of the file; initially \"1.0\". Since this file is designed to be human-readable but machine-writable, versioning the metadata makes sense as we don\\'t need to keep a backwards-compatible format for humans to directly work with and instead need a way to help tools migrate to newer metadata versions.\\n\\n## `indexes` \\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5\\nAn array of URLs to package indexes to use to find distributions. Recorded in most- to least-preferred order. Recording the indexes used helps when adding new lock entries by making the potential distributions consistent.\\n\\n## `dependencies`\\nArray of top-level dependency specifiers. This acts as the input of what to resolve for, so all details are to be included (e.g. extras, markers, etc.).\\n\\n## `[[lock]]`\\nA lock entry for an environment.\\n\\n## `lock.markers` \\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5\\nA table of environment markers used to produce the lock entry.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/resolve-markers-tags-requirements is an alternative that uses a list of relevant markers.\\n\\n## `lock.tags` \\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5\\nAn array of wheel tags supported by the environment as used to produce the lock entry. The tags are sorted from most- to least-preferred.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/resolve-markers-tags-requirements is an alternative that only lists the required wheel tag sets.\\n\\n## `[[lock.wheel]]`\\nA wheel file for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.name`\\nThe distribution\\'s normalized name. You cannot solely rely on the wheel filename to calculate this as the file name may not be a valid `.whl` file name due to [direct references](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#direct-references) (technically a tool could download the arbitrary URL and inspect it to determine the wheel file details if one so desired). Having the name as a distinct key also has the benefit that its easier to read than from a wheel file name.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.filename`\\nThe file\\'s name.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.origin`\\nA URL or file path (via `file://`) where the wheel that was locked against was found. The location does not need to exist in the future, so this should be treated as only a hint to where to look and/or recording where the wheel file originally came from.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.hashes`\\nA table of file hashes; algorithm:value pairs. This makes sure that one is getting the wheel file that was locked against for reproducibility and security purposes.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.direct`\\nWhether `origin` is the direct URL in terms of [`direct_url.json`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url/).\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.requires-python`\\nPython version requirement (optional). If an installer chooses to determine environment compatibility that is not as strict as an exact match of `lock.markers` and `lock.tags`, knowing the supporting Python versions is important to determine if this wheel file is compatible as this is not necessarily communicated via the wheel file name itself.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.dependencies`\\nA list of normalized distribution names which this distribution depends on (optional). Viewing the overall lock entry as the entire worldview of distributions available, each entry can be just the distribution name (a perk of Python not allowing multiple distribution versions simultaneously). This allows for introspection as to why a distribution is included in the lock entry (i.e. calculate the dependency graph between distributions). Details like extras and markers are not necessary as the resolver has already handled them.\\n\\nBecause this is not required to have a successful install, it is considered optional.\\n\\n## `[[lock.sdist]]`\\nA source distribution file for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.name`\\nSee `lock.wheel.name`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.filename`\\nSee `lock.wheel.filename`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.origin`\\nSee `lock.wheel.origin`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.hashes`\\nSee `lock.wheel.hashes`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.direct`\\nSee `lock.wheel.direct`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.requires-python`\\nSee `lock.wheel.requires-python`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.dependencies`\\nSee `lock.wheel.dependencies` for what is recorded in this array (optional). The contents may come from either:\\n- `PKG-INFO` if `Metadata-Version` is 2.2 or higher and the appropriate fields are not `Dynamic`.\\n- From building the sdist.\\n- Etc.\\n\\n## `[[lock.sdist.build-requires]]`\\nAn array of files that *can* be used or *were* used to build the sdist based on [`build-system.requires` from `pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#declaring-build-system-dependencies-the-build-system-table) (optional). The acceptable keys are `wheel` and `sdist` and their values match what is acceptable under the same name directly under `[[lock]]`. Any future expansion of acceptable distribution types under `[[lock]]` will also be supported here.\\n\\nThis effectively makes the table a self-contained lock entry just for this sdist with `build-system.requires` providing the value for `dependencies`.\\n\\nIt absent, it is at the installer\\'s discretion how to go about building the sdist (including refusing to).\\n\\n## `[[lock.git]]`\\nA Git repository of source code for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.git.name`\\nSee `lock.wheel.name`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.repo`\\nA URL to the Git repository; it may be a `file://` path.\\n\\n## `lock.git.commit`\\nThe commit of the repository to use. It should be a specific commit and not a tag or branch as those can change.\\n\\n## `lock.git.direct`\\nSee `lock.wheel.direct`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.requires-python`\\nSee `lock.wheel.requires-python`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.dependencies`\\nSee `lock.wheel.dependencies` for what is recorded in this array (optional). The contents may come from:\\n- `pyproject.toml` if `project.dependencies` (and `project.optional-dependencies` as appropriate) exists and is not `dynamic`.\\n- From building the repository based on its `pyproject.toml` file.\\n- Etc.\\n\\n## `[[lock.git.build-requires]]`\\nSee `lock.sdist.build-requires` (optional).\\n\\n## `[tool]`\\nSame as `pyproject.toml` (optional).\\n\\n# Examples\\n\\n- [A lock file with entries for multiple environments](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.compatibility-example.toml).\\n- [A larger lock file](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.graph-example.toml) w/ accompanying [dependency graph of the lock file](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.graph-example.md).\\n\\n# Proof of Concept\\nThe [`resolve` branch of my mousebender project](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/resolve) has a wheels-only, requires-PyPI-[PEP-714](https://peps.python.org/pep-0714/)-metadata lock generation tool (the restrictions are because I only have so much time and we now have alternative installers showing up, so I don\\'t need to aim for completeness). You can look at the [shell script that I use to generate the examples](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/update-examples.sh) listed above to see how to play with it. The `install` subcommand doesn\\'t do anything but list out the wheel filenames that would be installed since installation isn\\'t interesting thanks to the \\'installer` project and the only decision at install time is which lock entry to use.\\n\\nThe key point, though, is I was able to write a proof-of-concept that produces and consumes lock files based on this spec.\\n\\n# PEP 665 Comparison\\nThe most obvious difference is the inclusion of sdists from the start. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x81 But that was facilitated by making each distribution file type their own concept which is also different.

Checking the mousebender implementation I see you have \"strict\" and \"compatible\" matching defined. I think that in the actual PEP, it would be useful to document those two matching modes, even if you prefer them only to be examples, and explain when you\\'d expect each of them to be appropriate.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\npf_moore | 2024-02-22 10:52:00 UTC | #7\\n\\nI just wrote a very rough draft of a function to take a [pip installation report](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/installation-report/) and convert it into a lockfile. It seems pretty straightforward, but there are a couple of places where I had some questions.\\n\\n1. The installation report doesn\\'t record the wheel tags pip used, so I can\\'t populate the `lock.tags` array. The spec says this is optional, so I assume this isn\\'t technically an issue. A missing (which I assume is the same as \"empty\") tag set in the lockfile is compatible with any environment, so it\\'s simply up to the user not to use the lockfile in an inappropriate environment, which I think is fine.\\n2. I have to use the filename from the URL to determine if the entry file is a wheel or not. I don\\'t think that\\'s a major issue, but it does make the whole \"wheel vs sdist\" split feel a little artificial. The PEP should probably include a rationale for why it\\'s important to have separate `wheel` and `sdist` tables^[beyond \"everyone got up tight last time about sdists, so I wanted to keep them separate :slightly_smiling_face:].\\n3. Pip doesn\\'t record build environment details, so I have to omit `lock.sdist.build-requires`. I assume this would mean \"installers should use their default mechanism for creating a build environment, and so can\\'t guarantee reproducibility\", and I think that\\'s fine. Is that your expectation?\\n\\nI also note that the `lock.git` type doesn\\'t include a `build-requires` section. I assume it should, as a git repository contains source.\\n\\nAlso, while I see the practical reasons for having a specific \"git\" lock entry file type, I can see people pushing back on git getting \"special treatment\". Maybe the PEP should describe this in terms of general support for VCS file types, with git being the only one defined in this iteration of the spec, but additional VCS types can be added in future spec versions as needed. That doesn\\'t need to be anything more than a general statement that `[[lock.OTHER-VCS-NAME]]` is reserved for future use, at this point.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ncemici | 2024-02-22 11:23:17 UTC | #8\\n\\nDo I understand correctly that these lockfiles contain one `[lock]` entry for every possible (distinct) environment?\\n\\neg an entire description for \"python 3.10 and x86-64\", another entire description for \"python 3.9 and pypy and not extras=foo\", and so on?\\n\\nfor something like poetry, that would seem to require it to examine all of the markers that it encountered during locking, enumerate all of the exponentially many possible combinations, optionally merge where possible, and then write complete solutions for all of those possible combinations?\\n\\nEdit: a package with n extras - even if it supported exactly one environment - would have 2**n entries?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\naragilar | 2024-02-22 11:02:14 UTC | #9\\n\\nSome additional things you may want to consider (or defer/ignore):\\n\\n* How should `get_requires_for_build_sdist` and `get_requires_for_build_wheel` (I\\'m guessing they appear in `build-requires` tables, though maybe that should be called out explicitly).\\n* What happens when the metadata produced during a build differs from the lock file (e.g. sdist that produces different dependencies given a different environment)?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\njeanas | 2024-02-22 11:03:44 UTC | #10\\n\\n[quote=\"Brett Cannon, post:1, topic:46593, username:brettcannon\"]\\nAn inline table of hashes of this file\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contents w/o the line containing the table (i.e. including the newline); algorithm:value pairs.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nWhat algorithms are allowed?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\npf_moore | 2024-02-22 11:43:50 UTC | #11\\n\\n[quote=\"Brett Cannon, post:1, topic:46593, username:brettcannon\"]\\n## `lock.wheel.dependencies`\\n\\nA list of normalized distribution names which this distribution depends on. Viewing the overall lock entry as the entire worldview of distributions available, each entry can be just the distribution name (a perk of Python not allowing multiple distribution versions simultaneously). This allows for introspection as to why a distribution is included in the lock entry (i.e. calculate the dependency graph between distributions). Details like extras and markers are not necessary as the resolver has already handled them.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI\\'m not sure pip can determine this accurately. We know the dependency metadata from the distribution file, and we can strip out dependencies that don\\'t apply in this environment, but I\\'m not sure we can tell what extras apply for a transitive dependency. We know the extras requested by the user for a top-level dependency, but not necessarily for transitive ones. For example, `A` depends on `B[foo]`, `B` depends on `C`, and if `foo` is specified, `B` also depends on `D`. If we\\'re asked to install `A`, I don\\'t think pip knows that `D` is in the final resolve because of the extra `foo` - clearly *resolvelib* knows that, but I\\'m not sure if pip can recover that information after the resolve. I do know that the pip installation report doesn\\'t currently contain that data, so at the very least we\\'d need to modify the report output.\\n\\nIf it\\'s not possible to calculate the dependencies accurately, what\\'s the best thing for lockfile producers to do? Omit the field altogether, report the minimum (in this case, `B` depends on `C`), or report the maximum (that `B` depends on some of `C` and `D`)[^1]? Basically, I don\\'t really know what the intended use is for this field, and therefore whether partially accurate information is better or worse than no information at all.\\n\\n[^1]: Maximum might be difficult, actually - the marker API in `packaging` is rather limited in that it doesn\\'t really allow for \"evaluate, but ignoring extras\".\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nKound | 2024-02-22 12:10:24 UTC | #12\\n\\nIt might be worth considering also conda as a package lock source here.\\nThere are already several projects that try to combine `conda` and `pip` already, i.e.\\n\\n- https://github.com/basnijholt/unidep\\n- https://github.com/macro128/pdm-conda\\n- https://github.com/OldGrumpyViking/hatch-conda\\n\\nAnd I also understood that `uv` is intended to be included within `pixi` so that would also profit from this.\\n\\nI am aware that this is a controversial topic but given the scientific community is still heavily depended on conda for their work and they need reproducible environments I think this is worth considering.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ngroodt | 2024-02-22 12:33:13 UTC | #13\\n\\nconda has been explicitly mentioned as a non-goal in the initial post.\\n\"(i.e. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not trying to accommodate conda)\"\\n\\nconda already has lockfiles for environments and dependencies that users can benefit from, so I don\\'t think it makes sense to expand the scope of an already complex area (that has had multiple false starts and failures in its history) to accommodate a broadly isolated and not generally compatible ecosystem that doesn\\'t really suffer from lack of lockfiles.\\n\\nSure, perhaps in future once both ecosystems have lockfiles, interoperability between ecosystems could become a noble goal. However that feels like an entirely different problem and an entirely different evolution would be required if there was motivation for such a large overhaul of both ecosystems.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ngroodt | 2024-02-22 12:34:17 UTC | #14\\n\\nWhat\\'s the PEP number going to be?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nhugovk | 2024-02-22 13:35:03 UTC | #15\\n\\nIt\\'s a bit early for that.

Poetry does not lock for a specific environment, it creates an environment-independent lock file. It\\'s more like one lock file for all possible environments than a lock file for multiple specific environments.\\n\\n> [lock.marker] A table of environment markers used to produce the lock entry.\\n\\nPoetry does not use a set of markers to produce an entry in the lock file. A lock file entry in Poetry\\'s format cannot be mapped to a set of markers like `{python_version = \"3.10\", sys_platform = \"linux\"}` but to a marker condition like `\"python_version >= \\'3.9\\' and python_version < \\'3.12\\' or sys_platform == \\'linux\\'\"` (even though that\\'s not written to the lock file).\\n\\nFurther, we just lock all available dists for a locked package version and decide at install time which dist to use. I assume https://discuss.python.org/t/lock-files-again-but-this-time-w-sdists/46593/8 is right and it will result in an exponential explosion when we try to create a lock file in the proposed format.\\n\\nMaybe, I\\'m missing something but so far, I don\\'t think that Poetry could adopt this format without giving up its key features. I\\'m not saying that Poetry\\'s lock file format is better (it definitively has flaws), it just has a slightly different goal.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nsethmlarson | 2024-02-22 16:39:10 UTC | #17\\n\\nExciting!

Brett\\'s mousebender implementation has two modes:\\n\\n* Strict match, which checks if the markers and tags in the lock entry match the current environment exactly.\\n* \"Compatible\" match, which checks if the lock entry tags is a subset of the environment tags, and ignores markers.\\n\\nThese seem reasonable options, although I feel that strict matches could be fragile, especially given that we now have packaging utilities written in both Python and Rust, and we can\\'t assume that the exact values produced by the `packaging` library will be used by all tools (the precise list of tags supported by a given Python implementation isn\\'t standardised, for example, nor is it obtained by querying the interpreter).\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nlwasser | 2024-02-22 18:09:44 UTC | #21\\n\\nthanks @willingc watching the thread now! @ofek is hatch planning to support lock files in the future? i wasn\\'t aware of that feature currently but do know pdm and poetry each have a version of lock files. \\n\\nNote: for conda i normally use [condalock](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock) fwiw. i am not sure how or if those plugins for pdm and hatch would work into this equation. my experience is that they allow you to use your conda environments during development. my suspicion is that focusing on pip related locking vs trying to do conda as well might be cleaner because a full conda build will not happen using hatch or pdm on it\\'s own currently. \\n\\n*Disclaimer: take my thoughts with a grain of salt!*\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nofek | 2024-02-22 19:55:24 UTC | #22\\n\\n[quote=\"Leah Wasser, post:21, topic:46593, username:lwasser\"]\\nis hatch planning to support lock files in the future?\\n[/quote]\\n\\nYes, but as a wrapper around tools that will actually write that and then Hatch will appropriately map the lock files to specific environments. Most likely UV is what I\\'ll use.\\n\\n[quote=\"Randy D\\xc3\\xb6ring, post:16, topic:46593, username:radoering\"]\\nI think this goal is subtly but significantly different from Poetry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goal. Poetry does not lock for a specific environment, it creates an environment-independent lock file. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more like one lock file for all possible environments than a lock file for multiple specific environments.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nThis is a good distinction and I think the trade-off that Brett has made is worth it (and is in fact what the Pixi folks were going to do). Lockers would most likely default to whatever most developers use in addition to where services are most likely to be deployed. In my mind this means 4 targets: Windows 64-bit, macOS ARM, Linux 64-bit & ARM. Users can set specific targets to override the defaults if they wish.\\n\\nThis minimizes the work during installations which in turn limits what can go wrong in terms of bugs and security. Installation becomes iterating the entries to find which has tags that are compatible and then installing every URL. This format is also more amenable to security scanners and dependency updaters because the format is so simple.\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is The Way :tm:.\\n\\n[quote=\"Seth Michael Larson, post:17, topic:46593, username:sethmlarson\"]\\n[quote=\"brettcannon, post:1, topic:46593\"]\\nAn inline table of hashes of this file\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contents w/o the line containing the table (i.e. including the newline); algorithm:value pairs.

When dependabot runs, it creates 1 branch and merge request per update, w/ the idea that you let your CI run, and then auto-merge.\\nHowever, because of `content-hash` , with poetry, every single one of these branches has a merge conflict and must be manually dealt with, increasing the human time from a few seconds to ~10-minutes per, and, causing another run of the CI to be required.\\n\\nedit 2: a cursory glance at other lock files appears to show no precedence for storing such data. I looked at `Cargo.lock`, `yarn.lock`, `go.mod`/`go.sum`, and `Gemfile.lock`\\n\\nOther than this critique, I love the proposal and thank you very much for doing this Brett :smile:\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nBrenBarn | 2024-02-22 20:04:25 UTC | #23\\n\\nGood to see some ideas on this matter!  I will have to think about it more but have a couple small points:\\n\\nLike @sethmlarson I\\'m a bit concerned about the hashes being based on the raw text of the file.  It means that formatting distinctions which are semantically meaningless in TOML (such as whitespace or the use of different string delimiters) will affect the hash.\\n\\nNotably, the hash itself relies on one such formatting distinction: it is specified that it must be an *inline* table.  This makes me a bit nervous as it seems like an obvious pitfall for machine-writing.  It looks like the POC implementation doesn\\'t use any TOML-writer lib but rather a textual template into which values are placed.  That is okay for the POC, but in real life, if we expect this file format to be consumed and written by programs, a lot of those programs are going to want to just use a TOML-writing library.  As far as I can see, `toml` (the main TOML lib I see on PyPI) doesn\\'t have any support for stipulating that a particular table be output as inline.\\n\\nIt seems like the spec would be more robust if it could be described purely in terms of the semantic units of TOML (e.g., keys and values), without requiring a layer of special format handling (on input or output).\\n\\nMy other comment is that it would be helpful to have an example lockfile that includes sdists, since including sdists was the impetus for this proposal.  It looks like the current examples don\\'t have any.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nradoering | 2024-02-22 20:19:11 UTC | #24\\n\\n[quote=\"Ofek Lev, post:22, topic:46593, username:ofek\"]\\nIf you include either of these then multiple engineers contributing to the same code base will encounter merge conflicts frequently.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nCiting from the Poetry issue, you linked since this makes sense to me:\\n\\n> In general it is not possible safely to merge two independent changes to a lockfile without re-solving. One can construct examples in which an upgrade to A is possible, an upgrade to B is possible, but the upgraded A and B are incompatible with one another. So if some bot has proposed both upgrades then it would be an error to merge both, even if they are compatible so far as git can tell.

The two are closely tied together, though - should lockers write lock entries that are precisely targeted at very specific environments (marker + tag combinations), or ones that are as widely applicable as possible? Broad lock entries won\\'t be installable *anywhere* by an installer that insists on a strict/exact match^[Because a broad spec is by definition not an exact match], but tight ones could easily not be installable in environments where they would work perfectly well.\\n\\nFrom a producer\\'s point of view, the situation is:\\n\\n* For markers, it\\'s easy to write a precise specification, you just dump out the environment you used when evaluating specifiers for the resolve. That\\'s very precise, and quite probably includes data that\\'s strictly not needed (if the specifiers have no markers, the whole environment is irrelevant), but it\\'s easy to produce. To write *just* the relevant environment values requires the locker to parse the markers, which is complex and currently not available as library code. There would have to be a strong need to justify doing that.\\n* For tags, dumping out the valid tag set for the resolve environment is also easy^[Typically - I have a problem doing this, but that\\'s an oddity of the source data I\\'m using]. But again, it\\'s over-specified, and worse, if you don\\'t have access to an interpreter running in the target environment, it\\'s impossible to calculate in a deterministic way (there\\'s no standard for what\\'s in a system tag set, so even if you *do* have access to the target interpreter, the best you can do is produce \"what the `packaging` library returns\"). In this case, though, it\\'s relatively easy to build a \"minimal\" tag set - just parse the supported tag sets for all the wheels in the solve, and the minimal set is the union of those. Although now that I think about it, because tag sets are ordered, set union isn\\'t actually sufficient - but I can\\'t think of a place where ordering would be needed by a lockfile installer (which shouldn\\'t be doing any resolving) so it\\'s probably \"good enough\".\\n\\nI don\\'t want to derail this attempt at getting lockfiles by digging too deeply into the weeds of \"what it means to define a compatible environment\" but I think we do need to make sure that whatever\\'s in the spec is something that can be implemented in a practical way by both producers and consumers.\\n\\nFrom the feedback from the poetry folks here, it sounds like their approach is different, so I don\\'t know if their insights (beyond \"don\\'t do it that way\" :wink:) will be applicable. But even if the proposal here is not what they do, practical experience is very valuable in any form. It would also be useful to hear from PDM as to how they addressed this issue. And doesn\\'t pipenv do locking - what\\'s their view here?

I guess we can\\'t stop them, but we run the risk of ending up with installers and lockers being tightly coupled because they have a shared, but idiosyncratic, idea of what \"compatibility\" means. That doesn\\'t feel like a good outcome. Maybe I\\'ve been wearing my \"interoperability\" hat for too long, but I feel like a lockfile standard that doesn\\'t ensure that users can pick which locker and which installer to use independently, hasn\\'t done its job (after all, that\\'s what we have now - lock files tied to specific tool implementations).\\n\\nDetermining the best valid lock entry to use is up to the consumer. I think that\\'s fine. The producer\\'s job is just to provide a list of lock entries that work, not to judge the trade-offs for the target environment.\\n\\nBut with the above context, I\\'m not actually seeing the benefit of having the \"marker\" and \"tags\" values in an entry. They are (possibly) useful information, but beyond that I\\'m not sure. Put it this way. Suppose I\\'m writing an installer, and all I know is that I\\'m going to be handed a file that conforms to the lockfile standard, that was produced by *some* tool which is supposed to have included at least one lock entry that will work on this environment^[Basically, I\\'m assuming the user won\\'t try to install a lock file that they *know* isn\\'t going to work]. How can I use the `marker` and `tag` data as part of my decision process?\\n\\nThis isn\\'t hypothetical. Pip will need to install lockfiles, I imagine, and we\\'ll need to support a command line like `pip install --target staging_dir --platform manylinux_2_17 --lockfile xxx`. We won\\'t know who produced the lockfile, or what platform they were on when the locker ran, all we\\'ll know is that *somewhere* in that lockfile there\\'s a lock entry that the user believes is valid for the target platform. We won\\'t be able to build a `markers` mapping for a foreign environment, and our supported tag array is built using our own implementation, which could be subtly different than the one the locker used. I\\'m struggling at this point to see the benefit for an installer in looking at the `tags` and `markers` entries in a lockfile...\\n\\nSorry if I\\'m missing the point badly, here. I don\\'t have any experience with use cases for cross-platform or multi-platform lockfiles (or just cross-platform installs, to be honest!).

As @ofek alluded to earlier, from a secure supply chain perspective this proposal is a better fit in my opinion (else I would have proposed something else \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89). You can be very clear and know upfront what will be installed without any work with this proposal; you\\'re _locked_ into what would be installed. Poetry\\'s lock files, though, are more of a subset of the world at the time of locking where you still need to figure out what files apply to you at install time. To me that isn\\'t locking _files_ as much as locking a _subset_ of files that _may_ apply to you, but you won\\'t know until you run an installer. That makes auditing harder, etc. which are things secure supply chains care about (and thus I care about; I want to be able to look at a lock file with a single lock entry and go, \"yep, that\\'s what will be installed\" w/o having to think about it).\\n\\nThe same can be said about reproducibility of environments; I believe the potential variance of what gets installed is simpler to figure out with this proposal than with Poetry\\'s approach.\\n\\nBut as has been pointed out, the drawback of my proposal is the lock file is not inherently universally cross-platform without a locker choosing to make that happen, and even then it\\'s going to potentially be for a subset of platforms (it\\'s all a case-by-case basis based on what Python versions you care about, whether pure Python wheels are available, sdists, etc.).\\n\\nPros and cons, but for me I care about secure supply chain and installation reproducibility that easy to reason about.

When you lock for a set of requirements they are recorded in `dependencies`, so whatever extras you have in there are what you are locking for. Each lock entry represents a different set of distribution files that work together for some environment, so the only way I can think of extras in any way influencing the outcome is if some e.g. wheel file has another extra added in due to some marker making to only show up under a certain environment.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nrgommers | 2024-02-24 06:21:03 UTC | #56\\n\\n[quote=\"Brett Cannon, post:55, topic:46593, username:brettcannon\"]\\nPros and cons, but for me I care about secure supply chain and installation reproducibility that easy to reason about.

It looks to me like both types of lock files are important, just in very different scenarios. For example,\\n\\n1.

This means that you could be unit testing on Mac with different versions of a package than are used in production on Linux or on CI.\\n\\nObviously, this kind of behavior is expected for _different_ packages when you truly have markers that say something like \"install `tensorflow-macos` on mac, but `tensorflow` on Linux\", but having the identical packages possibly lock to other versions seems worrisome.\\n\\nFor example, we use Poetry and while it can sometimes be annoying to track down an issue where you lock on x86 and then someone tries to install on ARM and a wheel is missing, at least you get a nice error and then you know that you can manually pin to an older version. There aren\\'t \"silent\" differences that could sprout up unexpected differences at runtime due to differing versions of the same package.\\n\\nWe\\'ve found in practice that Poetry\\'s \"lock everything\" and \"pick what to install at runtime\" approach to be a lot less brittle than the `pip-tools` method of making independent, platform-specific lockfiles.

I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good thing.\\n\\nThat makes sense to me, and I think that the way to implement that from a lockfile specification perspective is to have all of\\n1) specifiers that define \"under which situations is this lockfile valid\"\\n2) specifiers for individual lockfile elements that define \"under which situations ought this package be installed\"\\n3) the ability to specify multiple dists with non-overlapping specifier sets in a specific lockfile\\n4) a strong preference or maybe outright \"shall\" requirement that tools that consume these lock files allow consumers to specify which lockfile to use (as requirements.txt files, and not as e.g. Pipenv and poetry)\\n\\n\\nThis allows tools to pick specific points in the configuration space that they want to live while letting them stay broadly compatible and lets people choose which side they want to live on. For instance, \\n- This covers the poetry folks\\' \"universal lock\" approach as I understand it: they would put an extremely broad (or perhaps empty) set of specifiers in (1); echo dependency dist specifiers to the dependency lines via (2) and hopefully detect places where that would leave a platform the user cares about broken and emit more copies of the dist requirement via (3) for those situations.\\n- The `mousebender` approach would be emitting multiple lockfiles with tight specifiers in (1) while not really emitting per-dist specifiers in (2) or multiple dists in (3) and relying on environment creators to implement (4) or autodetect (4).\\n- Something like pipenv blends the difference - its lockfiles specify a python requirement at the top, as in (1), and then platform requirements for individual dists throughout as in (2).\\n\\nThis also gives space via (3) to implement something that people often request of poetry, pipenv, and other environment creators of having a local-edit mode for specific dependencies, which is quite useful in a monorepo environment. Say you have a monorepo in which multiple packages are developed independently (in python terms - separate packages, separate `pyproject.toml`s) but depend on each other. When you distribute package A, you want its metadata to require some version-specifier of package B. When you\\'re doing local development, you really want the environment you use to have B installed editably with whatever version you see. Here, with the addition of some supplemental marker, you\\'d be able to have your cake and eat it too.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ncharliermarsh | 2024-02-24 14:00:45 UTC | #64\\n\\n[quote=\"Paul Moore, post:57, topic:46593, username:pf_moore\"]\\nThis came up in the previous lockfile discussion, where an important idea was that installing a lockfile should be possible *without* needing a resolver.

At the very least, I don\\'t believe that overall format (of a single listing that can include multiple entries for a single package, rather than a listing per platform) is not mutually exclusive with a hermetic lockfile.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ncharliermarsh | 2024-02-24 15:36:25 UTC | #70\\n\\n[quote=\"Ofek Lev, post:68, topic:46593, username:ofek\"]\\nIs there a technical reason why UV, Poetry or other tools cannot simply have good defaults if the concern is contributors on different platforms?

And I remain sympathetic to the idea that a \"just install these files\" style of locking, like this proposal, is a valid and useful thing to want. Maybe there\\'s *also* a need for a \"restrict the resolver to only considering these files\" form of \"locking\" *as a separate proposal*, but:\\n\\n1. No-one has yet put forward such a proposal, and\\n2. If we have two separate concepts, we *urgently* need to change our terminology so that we\\'re not calling both of them \"locking\".\\n\\n@brettcannon my view (speaking as potential PEP delegate) is that *your* proposal is based around the idea of a lockfile that says \"here\\'s a list of distribution files - download and install them\", and is focused on auditability and a limited form of reproducibility (where by \"limited\" I mean \"sdists muddy the water a bit\"). And that you consider the \"here\\'s a list of distribution files - go and resolve the stated requirements using only what\\'s on this list\" approach as out of scope. I\\'m happy to support that position, on the understanding that:\\n\\n1. You explicitly describe in the PEP the two models, and you clearly state which one your proposal is addressing.\\n2. You come up with some formal terminology to distinguish the two cases. I\\'m not so naive as to think that we\\'ll stop people calling them both \"lockfiles\" but I want the PEP at least to address the question of \"how do we talk about this\" precisely.\\n\\nIf someone wants to propose a \"list the files you apply a resolver to\" specification, I\\'ll happily consider that as an independent proposal. I\\'m not ecstatic about having two separate standards here, but I don\\'t want this work to fail yet again because we\\'re talking about multiple different things and never getting consensus or clarity as a result. Also, if someone has an idea for a \"merged\" approach which somehow addresses both models, please speak up! But be prepared for pushback - I\\'m pretty certain that trying to reconcile these two different views is what\\'s caused all of the previous proposals to fail.\\n\\n@charliermarsh - thanks for pushing this question.

Let\\'s say that your `dependencies` in the lockfile are exactly: `dependencies = [\"build\"]` . Very straightforward, nothing unusual, extremely popular package.

Then, the installer only has to evaluate the marker condition of each locked package/version to decide if it\\'s relevant for the target environment.

Since \"my vision\" cannot be written by any tool at the moment and I only believe it is (not sure it really is) possible for Poetry, it may turn out that it is impractical for any resolver to create this format. That\\'s neither a good starting point for standardization.\\n\\nFurther, only universal/environment-independent resolvers will be able to create such a format.

To me this seems like the most important thing.  Even if the proposal is separate from any concrete tools, it would be useful to see something like \"The intent is that with this proposal, we can create tools that will allow a user to do X\".\\n\\nAs usual, I actually think that it is important to make a decision on this matter (or at least clarify it somewhat) *before* we get too deep into the discussion of any particular proposal.  There is no point debating the technical details of a proposal unless, at the conceptual level, we think it can support the use cases that users currently feel are lacking.\\n\\nIf I understand right, the main point of contention is whether the lockfile specifies *exactly* what will be installed, or only specifies (as @sirosen called it) a \"boundary\" around what may be installed.  What use cases would push users toward wanting one of these behaviors versus the other?\\n\\nWhen I\\'m thinking about using lock files I\\'m mostly thinking about things like deploying a web app or distributing a desktop app.  The goal is to set up a \"known working\" environment.  From this perspective I feel like a \"strict\" lockfile makes more sense, because if the platform where I\\'m going to install the lockfile differs enough that the package set needs to be adjusted somehow, then it\\'s no longer a known-working environment.\\n\\nIf a lockfile format is created and finds its way into user-facing tools, my hunch is that users are going to be more irritated if the \"install from this lockfile\" operation seems to succeed, but then the software doesn\\'t actually work, than if the install errors out even though it actually could have worked (e.g., by ignoring certain constraints).  In the latter case, there is always the fallback of trying to do a \"regular\" install (i.e., with install-time resolving).  That again suggests to me that it makes more sense to err on the side of strictness, and prefer false-negatives (\"this says it won\\'t work but I can make it work\") to false-positives (\"this says it will work but it doesn\\'t\").\\n\\n[quote=\"Paul Moore, post:47, topic:46593, username:pf_moore\"]\\nSuppose I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m writing an installer, and all I know is that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be handed a file that conforms to the lockfile standard, that was produced by *some* tool which is supposed to have included at least one lock entry that will work on this environment[1]. How can I use the `marker` and `tag` data as part of my decision process?\\n\\n1: Basically, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m assuming the user won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to install a lock file that they *know* isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to work\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI quoted the footnote here because I think there is a subtle but important difference between what it says and what the main text of your comment says.  In the main text, you\\'re speaking from the perspective of someone writing an installer, and you assume the lockfile you\\'re handed will work on this environment.  But in the footnote it\\'s the user who knows the lockfile won\\'t work.  But these perspectives are quite different.  The beliefs of users about whether the lock file will work is likely to depend on much more than just what tool produced it, and in fact, in many cases the user may have little or no understanding of what tool produced it or how.  Instead they will often be seeing instructions on some project\\'s website that say \"to install this project, type `installfromlockfile mylockfile.lock`\", and it is on that basis that they will believe that it will work.\\n\\nMy point here is just that, although I agree users will probably not try to install a lockfile that *they* know won\\'t work, there may be many cases in which they try to install a lockfile that *we* know won\\'t work (or that the project author or installer author knows won\\'t work).  :slight_smile: I think this is relevant if we think about the robustness or failure modes of the lockfile, along the lines I described above.\\n\\nSo I agree with your point that maybe markers and tags aren\\'t so relevant.  In the end what I see as the point of lockfiles is providing a sort of anchor or lever that allows software authors to provide a greater degree of confidence to software users: \"if you use this tool to install this lockfile, and the operation succeeds, you will get a working version of my software\".  The usefulness of that guarantee depends on the tradeoff between how many caveats it has to have (i.e., does the user have to use a specific install tool, what happens if the operation fails) and how much can be guaranteed, and I think we should have that tradeoff in mind when thinking about the design.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ngroodt | 2024-02-24 20:56:33 UTC | #96\\n\\n[quote=\"Cemici, post:94, topic:46593, username:cemici\"]\\nsure, but that is saying the same thing from the other end.

Apologies if some of the comments are therefore a little out of date).\\n\\n[quote=\"Greg Roodt, post:91, topic:46593, username:groodt\"]\\nI think the use case would be something along the lines of:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cgenerate universal constraints on any platform, install from universal constraints on any platform\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI\\'m still confused. Let me try and turn that into something that\\'s as specific as I\\'d like.\\n\\nI\\'m writing some code in Python, and in order to run it, I need a number of libraries. For my development, I\\'m using a `requirements.txt` file to install the libraries into a virtual environment, but I don\\'t fix the versions of my dependencies - as long as my code works, I\\'m good.\\n\\nNow, I want to share my code with my colleagues. In order to ensure they get the same results that I get, I want to make sure they are using the same software that I\\'m using, so I feed my `requirements.txt` file into a \"locker\" which spits out a Python lock file. I can now share my scripts, plus that lock file, and my colleagues can use an installer to create an environment containing exactly the same software as I have been using, and do their own analysis and get the same results.\\n\\n(I\\'ll note at this point that this use case implies that I want my colleagues to use the same *Python* version as me, as well. I\\'m not sure I can think of a realistic scenario where I\\'d care about them using the same versions of my dependencies, but not use the same Python version).\\n\\nBrett\\'s proposal seems to cover this case just fine.\\n\\nNow let\\'s suppose that one of my colleagues is using a Mac, and I\\'m using Windows. OK, that *might* be an issue. I don\\'t have access to a Mac. Luckily, though, my locker allows me to say `lock --platform=mac` and it creates a lock file for the Mac.\\n\\nThis is *still* supported by Brett\\'s proposal, assuming that cross-platform resolving is possible. The *locker* needs to be able to resolve for a Mac while running on a Windows system. And that\\'s certainly possible (with the usual caveats about sdists and build-time code execution), because you can construct your own marker and tag set, and run a resolve using that. But it\\'s just a problem for the locker, not for any other part of the chain.\\n\\nI\\'m still not seeing why it\\'s of any advantage to leave the target computer to do the resolve here.\\n\\n[quote=\"Greg Roodt, post:91, topic:46593, username:groodt\"]\\nThe proposal (eager evaluation) would appear to fail-fast and refuse to produce a lockfile for an environment that wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be possible to install at some later point. It gives you a guarantee in some sense. For example, if you know you are targeting some \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccloud lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x9d runtime, and you produce a lockfile for some \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccloud lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x9d runtime ahead of time, you can broadly send the lockfile to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccloud lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x9d runtime and it could fetch and install and run (ignoring a whole suite of sdist or network issues) and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have greater guarantees it would work.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI don\\'t follow this at all. Isn\\'t the whole *point* to be able to know that you can send the lockfile to the target environment and be sure that it will run? That\\'s *why* you want to precompute the exact wheels (or sdists if you must) that you want the target to download and install. If you\\'re not doing that, why not just send a requirements file (or a standardised equivalent)?\\n\\nNote that I\\'m very definitely *not* seeing lockfiles as just \"standardised reqirements files\", and if anyone is thinking that, then we have a very different understanding of what locking is - after all, this is a perfectly valid requirements file:\\n\\n```\\nrich\\nclick >= 7.0\\n```\\n\\nBut there\\'s no way I\\'d consider that as a \"lock file\"!\\n\\nI\\'m really not seeing why people are insisting that there\\'s a need for the *installer* to do a second resolve here. That seems to me like it\\'s the step that lockfiles are designed to eliminate. If it\\'s not, then what benefit *is* using a lockfile giving (over a requirements file^[insert \"or a standardised equivalent\" boilerplate here], to be concrete)?\\n\\nI\\'m sorry if I\\'m being particularly dense here. I\\'m trying to understand the problem you\\'re describing, because I don\\'t want to end up approving a standard that doesn\\'t address the needs people have. But I\\'m not going to reject the proposal based on a scenario that no-one can describe clearly enough to show where the proposal fails!\\n\\n[quote=\"Cemici, post:92, topic:46593, username:cemici\"]\\nAnd the way in which the current proposal does not work for that use case is that it requires the resolver to enumerate a combinatorially large number of possible environments in the lock file.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nThank you for being explicit. So what you\\'re saying is that you want to be able to request a lockfile that\\'s intended to be usable on *any* platform, without needing to explicitly state what platforms you\\'re targetting? OK, I can see that would be an problematic situation - as you say, it\\'s a combinatorial explosion.\\n\\nBut is it realistic? If, as @ofek suggested, lockers default to supporting the major platforms, and you cover a sensible set of python versions (at worst, 5 versions if you limit yourself to supported minor versions, 2 if you omit security fix only releases), then it\\'s entirely manageable. And I\\'m still struggling to think of a scenario where I\\'d use a lockfile and I *couldn\\'t* say something like \"you need to use the same Python version as I used\", so that\\'s just *one* Python version. And in my scenario, as I described it above, adding a new lock target when people ask for an additional platform to be supported seems like it\\'s *also* a perfectly fair way of handling that situation.\\n\\nYour \"universal\" lockfile sounds more like a base set of requirements, combined with some form of \"snapshot\" of the state of the relevant package index(es) to me. Which is an interesting, and potentially useful, idea - but not at all what I\\'d describe as \"locking\".\\n\\nBut the point here isn\\'t to make judgements on scenarios as described. Thank you (and Greg) for the explanation of the scenario. I think Brett has already said he plans on considering this model out of scope, and based on what I\\'ve seen here that seems like a fair decision to me. I\\'m happy to hear of other scenarios if you think I\\'m still missing something important.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ngroodt | 2024-02-24 21:29:04 UTC | #98\\n\\n[quote=\"Paul Moore, post:97, topic:46593, username:pf_moore\"]\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really not seeing why people are insisting that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a need for the *installer* to do a second resolve here.

       "'brettcannon | 2024-02-26 20:25:08 UTC | #1\\n\\nTwo years since [PEP 665](https://peps.python.org/pep-0665/) was [rejected](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-665-take-2-a-file-format-to-list-python-dependencies-for-reproducibility-of-an-application/11736/140) and three years since I started working towards some lock file solution, I present my next (and last regardless of outcome) attempt at coming up with a lock file standard.\\n\\n# Terms\\n\\n- \"platform\": OS plus CPU\\n- \"environment\": interpreter plus platform\\n- \"distribution\": in the PyPA spec sense, i.e. a project\\n- \"lock entry\": a set of distribution files locked for a specific environment\\n- \"lock file\": a set of lock entries for a specific set of [dependency specifiers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/) from a specific set of indexes\\n\\n# Goals\\n\\n- An environment lock file standard for https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/ (i.e. I\\'m not trying to accommodate conda and this is not what `Poetry.lock` provides which you could consider a boundary/constraint file)\\n- The ability to lock for multiple environments simultaneously for the same set of dependency specifiers\\n- You can update all entries in a lock file regardless of the platform you are running on (i.e. all inputs into the resolver are recorded in the lock file)\\n- You can have different lock files for different reasons\\n- Installation involves determining which lock entry best applies to an environment, then its a linear install of all distribution files in the lock entry, i.e. no evaluation as to whether an individual distribution file should be installed once a lock entry is chosen, so no SAT solver is necessary\\n- The file format is human-readable for ease of e.g. auditing diffs, but is machine-writable (i.e. not meant to be written by hand)\\n- Not meant to introduce new packaging concepts outside of lock files themselves\\n- Make the sdist people happy so this gets accepted 😉\\n\\n# Spec\\nLock files should be written out to a `pylock.*.toml` file w/ a label to help identify the lock file\\'s purpose. The file format is TOML.\\n\\nThe allowed keys in the file are listed below (all keys are required unless specified as optional). A TOML file with this also written out can be found at https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.spec.toml . Examples of lock files are listed later on.\\n\\nAnything w/ a 🔥 means it\\'s a contentious key.\\n\\n## `meta`\\nMetadata version of the file; initially \"1.0\". Since this file is designed to be human-readable but machine-writable, versioning the metadata makes sense as we don\\'t need to keep a backwards-compatible format for humans to directly work with and instead need a way to help tools migrate to newer metadata versions.\\n\\n## `indexes` 🔥\\nAn array of URLs to package indexes to use to find distributions. Recorded in most- to least-preferred order. Recording the indexes used helps when adding new lock entries by making the potential distributions consistent.\\n\\n## `dependencies`\\nArray of top-level dependency specifiers. This acts as the input of what to resolve for, so all details are to be included (e.g. extras, markers, etc.).\\n\\n## `[[lock]]`\\nA lock entry for an environment.\\n\\n## `lock.markers` 🔥\\nA table of environment markers used to produce the lock entry.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/resolve-markers-tags-requirements is an alternative that uses a list of relevant markers.\\n\\n## `lock.tags` 🔥\\nAn array of wheel tags supported by the environment as used to produce the lock entry. The tags are sorted from most- to least-preferred.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/resolve-markers-tags-requirements is an alternative that only lists the required wheel tag sets.\\n\\n## `[[lock.wheel]]`\\nA wheel file for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.name`\\nThe distribution\\'s normalized name. You cannot solely rely on the wheel filename to calculate this as the file name may not be a valid `.whl` file name due to [direct references](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#direct-references) (technically a tool could download the arbitrary URL and inspect it to determine the wheel file details if one so desired). Having the name as a distinct key also has the benefit that its easier to read than from a wheel file name.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.filename`\\nThe file\\'s name.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.origin`\\nA URL or file path (via `file://`) where the wheel that was locked against was found. The location does not need to exist in the future, so this should be treated as only a hint to where to look and/or recording where the wheel file originally came from.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.hashes`\\nA table of file hashes; algorithm:value pairs. This makes sure that one is getting the wheel file that was locked against for reproducibility and security purposes.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.direct`\\nWhether `origin` is the direct URL in terms of [`direct_url.json`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url/).\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.requires-python`\\nPython version requirement (optional). If an installer chooses to determine environment compatibility that is not as strict as an exact match of `lock.markers` and `lock.tags`, knowing the supporting Python versions is important to determine if this wheel file is compatible as this is not necessarily communicated via the wheel file name itself.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.dependencies`\\nA list of normalized distribution names which this distribution depends on (optional). Viewing the overall lock entry as the entire worldview of distributions available, each entry can be just the distribution name (a perk of Python not allowing multiple distribution versions simultaneously). This allows for introspection as to why a distribution is included in the lock entry (i.e. calculate the dependency graph between distributions). Details like extras and markers are not necessary as the resolver has already handled them.\\n\\nBecause this is not required to have a successful install, it is considered optional.\\n\\n## `[[lock.sdist]]`\\nA source distribution file for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.name`\\nSee `lock.wheel.name`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.filename`\\nSee `lock.wheel.filename`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.origin`\\nSee `lock.wheel.origin`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.hashes`\\nSee `lock.wheel.hashes`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.direct`\\nSee `lock.wheel.direct`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.requires-python`\\nSee `lock.wheel.requires-python`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.dependencies`\\nSee `lock.wheel.dependencies` for what is recorded in this array (optional). The contents may come from either:\\n- `PKG-INFO` if `Metadata-Version` is 2.2 or higher and the appropriate fields are not `Dynamic`.\\n- From building the sdist.\\n- Etc.\\n\\n## `[[lock.sdist.build-requires]]`\\nAn array of files that *can* be used or *were* used to build the sdist based on [`build-system.requires` from `pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#declaring-build-system-dependencies-the-build-system-table) (optional). The acceptable keys are `wheel` and `sdist` and their values match what is acceptable under the same name directly under `[[lock]]`. Any future expansion of acceptable distribution types under `[[lock]]` will also be supported here.\\n\\nThis effectively makes the table a self-contained lock entry just for this sdist with `build-system.requires` providing the value for `dependencies`.\\n\\nIt absent, it is at the installer\\'s discretion how to go about building the sdist (including refusing to).\\n\\n## `[[lock.git]]`\\nA Git repository of source code for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.git.name`\\nSee `lock.wheel.name`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.repo`\\nA URL to the Git repository; it may be a `file://` path.\\n\\n## `lock.git.commit`\\nThe commit of the repository to use. It should be a specific commit and not a tag or branch as those can change.\\n\\n## `lock.git.direct`\\nSee `lock.wheel.direct`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.requires-python`\\nSee `lock.wheel.requires-python`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.dependencies`\\nSee `lock.wheel.dependencies` for what is recorded in this array (optional).

It seems pretty straightforward, but there are a couple of places where I had some questions.\\n\\n1. The installation report doesn\\'t record the wheel tags pip used, so I can\\'t populate the `lock.tags` array. The spec says this is optional, so I assume this isn\\'t technically an issue. A missing (which I assume is the same as \"empty\") tag set in the lockfile is compatible with any environment, so it\\'s simply up to the user not to use the lockfile in an inappropriate environment, which I think is fine.\\n2. I have to use the filename from the URL to determine if the entry file is a wheel or not. I don\\'t think that\\'s a major issue, but it does make the whole \"wheel vs sdist\" split feel a little artificial. The PEP should probably include a rationale for why it\\'s important to have separate `wheel` and `sdist` tables^[beyond \"everyone got up tight last time about sdists, so I wanted to keep them separate :slightly_smiling_face:].\\n3. Pip doesn\\'t record build environment details, so I have to omit `lock.sdist.build-requires`. I assume this would mean \"installers should use their default mechanism for creating a build environment, and so can\\'t guarantee reproducibility\", and I think that\\'s fine. Is that your expectation?\\n\\nI also note that the `lock.git` type doesn\\'t include a `build-requires` section. I assume it should, as a git repository contains source.\\n\\nAlso, while I see the practical reasons for having a specific \"git\" lock entry file type, I can see people pushing back on git getting \"special treatment\". Maybe the PEP should describe this in terms of general support for VCS file types, with git being the only one defined in this iteration of the spec, but additional VCS types can be added in future spec versions as needed. That doesn\\'t need to be anything more than a general statement that `[[lock.OTHER-VCS-NAME]]` is reserved for future use, at this point.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ncemici | 2024-02-22 11:23:17 UTC | #8\\n\\nDo I understand correctly that these lockfiles contain one `[lock]` entry for every possible (distinct) environment?\\n\\neg an entire description for \"python 3.10 and x86-64\", another entire description for \"python 3.9 and pypy and not extras=foo\", and so on?\\n\\nfor something like poetry, that would seem to require it to examine all of the markers that it encountered during locking, enumerate all of the exponentially many possible combinations, optionally merge where possible, and then write complete solutions for all of those possible combinations?\\n\\nEdit: a package with n extras - even if it supported exactly one environment - would have 2**n entries?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\naragilar | 2024-02-22 11:02:14 UTC | #9\\n\\nSome additional things you may want to consider (or defer/ignore):\\n\\n* How should `get_requires_for_build_sdist` and `get_requires_for_build_wheel` (I\\'m guessing they appear in `build-requires` tables, though maybe that should be called out explicitly).\\n* What happens when the metadata produced during a build differs from the lock file (e.g. sdist that produces different dependencies given a different environment)?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\njeanas | 2024-02-22 11:03:44 UTC | #10\\n\\n[quote=\"Brett Cannon, post:1, topic:46593, username:brettcannon\"]\\nAn inline table of hashes of this file’s contents w/o the line containing the table (i.e. including the newline); algorithm:value pairs.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nWhat algorithms are allowed?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\npf_moore | 2024-02-22 11:43:50 UTC | #11\\n\\n[quote=\"Brett Cannon, post:1, topic:46593, username:brettcannon\"]\\n## `lock.wheel.dependencies`\\n\\nA list of normalized distribution names which this distribution depends on. Viewing the overall lock entry as the entire worldview of distributions available, each entry can be just the distribution name (a perk of Python not allowing multiple distribution versions simultaneously). This allows for introspection as to why a distribution is included in the lock entry (i.e. calculate the dependency graph between distributions). Details like extras and markers are not necessary as the resolver has already handled them.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI\\'m not sure pip can determine this accurately. We know the dependency metadata from the distribution file, and we can strip out dependencies that don\\'t apply in this environment, but I\\'m not sure we can tell what extras apply for a transitive dependency. We know the extras requested by the user for a top-level dependency, but not necessarily for transitive ones. For example, `A` depends on `B[foo]`, `B` depends on `C`, and if `foo` is specified, `B` also depends on `D`. If we\\'re asked to install `A`, I don\\'t think pip knows that `D` is in the final resolve because of the extra `foo` - clearly *resolvelib* knows that, but I\\'m not sure if pip can recover that information after the resolve. I do know that the pip installation report doesn\\'t currently contain that data, so at the very least we\\'d need to modify the report output.\\n\\nIf it\\'s not possible to calculate the dependencies accurately, what\\'s the best thing for lockfile producers to do? Omit the field altogether, report the minimum (in this case, `B` depends on `C`), or report the maximum (that `B` depends on some of `C` and `D`)[^1]? Basically, I don\\'t really know what the intended use is for this field, and therefore whether partially accurate information is better or worse than no information at all.\\n\\n[^1]: Maximum might be difficult, actually - the marker API in `packaging` is rather limited in that it doesn\\'t really allow for \"evaluate, but ignoring extras\".\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nKound | 2024-02-22 12:10:24 UTC | #12\\n\\nIt might be worth considering also conda as a package lock source here.\\nThere are already several projects that try to combine `conda` and `pip` already, i.e.\\n\\n- https://github.com/basnijholt/unidep\\n- https://github.com/macro128/pdm-conda\\n- https://github.com/OldGrumpyViking/hatch-conda\\n\\nAnd I also understood that `uv` is intended to be included within `pixi` so that would also profit from this.\\n\\nI am aware that this is a controversial topic but given the scientific community is still heavily depended on conda for their work and they need reproducible environments I think this is worth considering.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ngroodt | 2024-02-22 12:33:13 UTC | #13\\n\\nconda has been explicitly mentioned as a non-goal in the initial post.\\n\"(i.e. I’m not trying to accommodate conda)\"\\n\\nconda already has lockfiles for environments and dependencies that users can benefit from, so I don\\'t think it makes sense to expand the scope of an already complex area (that has had multiple false starts and failures in its history) to accommodate a broadly isolated and not generally compatible ecosystem that doesn\\'t really suffer from lack of lockfiles.\\n\\nSure, perhaps in future once both ecosystems have lockfiles, interoperability between ecosystems could become a noble goal.

PIp isn\\'t a multi-environment installer and so couldn\\'t do multi-environment locks.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what installers are intended to do here. Brett\\'s mousebender implementation has two modes:\\n\\n* Strict match, which checks if the markers and tags in the lock entry match the current environment exactly.\\n* \"Compatible\" match, which checks if the lock entry tags is a subset of the environment tags, and ignores markers.\\n\\nThese seem reasonable options, although I feel that strict matches could be fragile, especially given that we now have packaging utilities written in both Python and Rust, and we can\\'t assume that the exact values produced by the `packaging` library will be used by all tools (the precise list of tags supported by a given Python implementation isn\\'t standardised, for example, nor is it obtained by querying the interpreter).\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nlwasser | 2024-02-22 18:09:44 UTC | #21\\n\\nthanks @willingc watching the thread now! @ofek is hatch planning to support lock files in the future? i wasn\\'t aware of that feature currently but do know pdm and poetry each have a version of lock files. \\n\\nNote: for conda i normally use [condalock](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock) fwiw. i am not sure how or if those plugins for pdm and hatch would work into this equation. my experience is that they allow you to use your conda environments during development. my suspicion is that focusing on pip related locking vs trying to do conda as well might be cleaner because a full conda build will not happen using hatch or pdm on it\\'s own currently. \\n\\n*Disclaimer: take my thoughts with a grain of salt!*\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nofek | 2024-02-22 19:55:24 UTC | #22\\n\\n[quote=\"Leah Wasser, post:21, topic:46593, username:lwasser\"]\\nis hatch planning to support lock files in the future?\\n[/quote]\\n\\nYes, but as a wrapper around tools that will actually write that and then Hatch will appropriately map the lock files to specific environments.

Lockers would most likely default to whatever most developers use in addition to where services are most likely to be deployed. In my mind this means 4 targets: Windows 64-bit, macOS ARM, Linux 64-bit & ARM. Users can set specific targets to override the defaults if they wish.\\n\\nThis minimizes the work during installations which in turn limits what can go wrong in terms of bugs and security. Installation becomes iterating the entries to find which has tags that are compatible and then installing every URL. This format is also more amenable to security scanners and dependency updaters because the format is so simple.\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is The Way :tm:.\\n\\n[quote=\"Seth Michael Larson, post:17, topic:46593, username:sethmlarson\"]\\n[quote=\"brettcannon, post:1, topic:46593\"]\\nAn inline table of hashes of this file’s contents w/o the line containing the table (i.e. including the newline); algorithm:value pairs.

I will have to think about it more but have a couple small points:\\n\\nLike @sethmlarson I\\'m a bit concerned about the hashes being based on the raw text of the file.  It means that formatting distinctions which are semantically meaningless in TOML (such as whitespace or the use of different string delimiters) will affect the hash.\\n\\nNotably, the hash itself relies on one such formatting distinction: it is specified that it must be an *inline* table.  This makes me a bit nervous as it seems like an obvious pitfall for machine-writing.  It looks like the POC implementation doesn\\'t use any TOML-writer lib but rather a textual template into which values are placed.  That is okay for the POC, but in real life, if we expect this file format to be consumed and written by programs, a lot of those programs are going to want to just use a TOML-writing library.  As far as I can see, `toml` (the main TOML lib I see on PyPI) doesn\\'t have any support for stipulating that a particular table be output as inline.\\n\\nIt seems like the spec would be more robust if it could be described purely in terms of the semantic units of TOML (e.g., keys and values), without requiring a layer of special format handling (on input or output).\\n\\nMy other comment is that it would be helpful to have an example lockfile that includes sdists, since including sdists was the impetus for this proposal.  It looks like the current examples don\\'t have any.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nradoering | 2024-02-22 20:19:11 UTC | #24\\n\\n[quote=\"Ofek Lev, post:22, topic:46593, username:ofek\"]\\nIf you include either of these then multiple engineers contributing to the same code base will encounter merge conflicts frequently.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nCiting from the Poetry issue, you linked since this makes sense to me:\\n\\n> In general it is not possible safely to merge two independent changes to a lockfile without re-solving. One can construct examples in which an upgrade to A is possible, an upgrade to B is possible, but the upgraded A and B are incompatible with one another. So if some bot has proposed both upgrades then it would be an error to merge both, even if they are compatible so far as git can tell.

The two are closely tied together, though - should lockers write lock entries that are precisely targeted at very specific environments (marker + tag combinations), or ones that are as widely applicable as possible? Broad lock entries won\\'t be installable *anywhere* by an installer that insists on a strict/exact match^[Because a broad spec is by definition not an exact match], but tight ones could easily not be installable in environments where they would work perfectly well.\\n\\nFrom a producer\\'s point of view, the situation is:\\n\\n* For markers, it\\'s easy to write a precise specification, you just dump out the environment you used when evaluating specifiers for the resolve. That\\'s very precise, and quite probably includes data that\\'s strictly not needed (if the specifiers have no markers, the whole environment is irrelevant), but it\\'s easy to produce. To write *just* the relevant environment values requires the locker to parse the markers, which is complex and currently not available as library code. There would have to be a strong need to justify doing that.\\n* For tags, dumping out the valid tag set for the resolve environment is also easy^[Typically - I have a problem doing this, but that\\'s an oddity of the source data I\\'m using]. But again, it\\'s over-specified, and worse, if you don\\'t have access to an interpreter running in the target environment, it\\'s impossible to calculate in a deterministic way (there\\'s no standard for what\\'s in a system tag set, so even if you *do* have access to the target interpreter, the best you can do is produce \"what the `packaging` library returns\"). In this case, though, it\\'s relatively easy to build a \"minimal\" tag set - just parse the supported tag sets for all the wheels in the solve, and the minimal set is the union of those. Although now that I think about it, because tag sets are ordered, set union isn\\'t actually sufficient - but I can\\'t think of a place where ordering would be needed by a lockfile installer (which shouldn\\'t be doing any resolving) so it\\'s probably \"good enough\".\\n\\nI don\\'t want to derail this attempt at getting lockfiles by digging too deeply into the weeds of \"what it means to define a compatible environment\" but I think we do need to make sure that whatever\\'s in the spec is something that can be implemented in a practical way by both producers and consumers.\\n\\nFrom the feedback from the poetry folks here, it sounds like their approach is different, so I don\\'t know if their insights (beyond \"don\\'t do it that way\" :wink:) will be applicable. But even if the proposal here is not what they do, practical experience is very valuable in any form. It would also be useful to hear from PDM as to how they addressed this issue.

I guess we can\\'t stop them, but we run the risk of ending up with installers and lockers being tightly coupled because they have a shared, but idiosyncratic, idea of what \"compatibility\" means. That doesn\\'t feel like a good outcome. Maybe I\\'ve been wearing my \"interoperability\" hat for too long, but I feel like a lockfile standard that doesn\\'t ensure that users can pick which locker and which installer to use independently, hasn\\'t done its job (after all, that\\'s what we have now - lock files tied to specific tool implementations).\\n\\nDetermining the best valid lock entry to use is up to the consumer. I think that\\'s fine. The producer\\'s job is just to provide a list of lock entries that work, not to judge the trade-offs for the target environment.\\n\\nBut with the above context, I\\'m not actually seeing the benefit of having the \"marker\" and \"tags\" values in an entry. They are (possibly) useful information, but beyond that I\\'m not sure. Put it this way. Suppose I\\'m writing an installer, and all I know is that I\\'m going to be handed a file that conforms to the lockfile standard, that was produced by *some* tool which is supposed to have included at least one lock entry that will work on this environment^[Basically, I\\'m assuming the user won\\'t try to install a lock file that they *know* isn\\'t going to work]. How can I use the `marker` and `tag` data as part of my decision process?\\n\\nThis isn\\'t hypothetical. Pip will need to install lockfiles, I imagine, and we\\'ll need to support a command line like `pip install --target staging_dir --platform manylinux_2_17 --lockfile xxx`. We won\\'t know who produced the lockfile, or what platform they were on when the locker ran, all we\\'ll know is that *somewhere* in that lockfile there\\'s a lock entry that the user believes is valid for the target platform. We won\\'t be able to build a `markers` mapping for a foreign environment, and our supported tag array is built using our own implementation, which could be subtly different than the one the locker used. I\\'m struggling at this point to see the benefit for an installer in looking at the `tags` and `markers` entries in a lockfile...\\n\\nSorry if I\\'m missing the point badly, here. I don\\'t have any experience with use cases for cross-platform or multi-platform lockfiles (or just cross-platform installs, to be honest!).

As @ofek alluded to earlier, from a secure supply chain perspective this proposal is a better fit in my opinion (else I would have proposed something else 😉). You can be very clear and know upfront what will be installed without any work with this proposal; you\\'re _locked_ into what would be installed. Poetry\\'s lock files, though, are more of a subset of the world at the time of locking where you still need to figure out what files apply to you at install time. To me that isn\\'t locking _files_ as much as locking a _subset_ of files that _may_ apply to you, but you won\\'t know until you run an installer. That makes auditing harder, etc. which are things secure supply chains care about (and thus I care about; I want to be able to look at a lock file with a single lock entry and go, \"yep, that\\'s what will be installed\" w/o having to think about it).\\n\\nThe same can be said about reproducibility of environments; I believe the potential variance of what gets installed is simpler to figure out with this proposal than with Poetry\\'s approach.\\n\\nBut as has been pointed out, the drawback of my proposal is the lock file is not inherently universally cross-platform without a locker choosing to make that happen, and even then it\\'s going to potentially be for a subset of platforms (it\\'s all a case-by-case basis based on what Python versions you care about, whether pure Python wheels are available, sdists, etc.).\\n\\nPros and cons, but for me I care about secure supply chain and installation reproducibility that easy to reason about.

When you lock for a set of requirements they are recorded in `dependencies`, so whatever extras you have in there are what you are locking for. Each lock entry represents a different set of distribution files that work together for some environment, so the only way I can think of extras in any way influencing the outcome is if some e.g. wheel file has another extra added in due to some marker making to only show up under a certain environment.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nrgommers | 2024-02-24 06:21:03 UTC | #56\\n\\n[quote=\"Brett Cannon, post:55, topic:46593, username:brettcannon\"]\\nPros and cons, but for me I care about secure supply chain and installation reproducibility that easy to reason about.

It looks to me like both types of lock files are important, just in very different scenarios. For example,\\n\\n1.

There aren\\'t \"silent\" differences that could sprout up unexpected differences at runtime due to differing versions of the same package.\\n\\nWe\\'ve found in practice that Poetry\\'s \"lock everything\" and \"pick what to install at runtime\" approach to be a lot less brittle than the `pip-tools` method of making independent, platform-specific lockfiles.

I think that’s a good thing.\\n\\nThat makes sense to me, and I think that the way to implement that from a lockfile specification perspective is to have all of\\n1) specifiers that define \"under which situations is this lockfile valid\"\\n2) specifiers for individual lockfile elements that define \"under which situations ought this package be installed\"\\n3) the ability to specify multiple dists with non-overlapping specifier sets in a specific lockfile\\n4) a strong preference or maybe outright \"shall\" requirement that tools that consume these lock files allow consumers to specify which lockfile to use (as requirements.txt files, and not as e.g. Pipenv and poetry)\\n\\n\\nThis allows tools to pick specific points in the configuration space that they want to live while letting them stay broadly compatible and lets people choose which side they want to live on. For instance, \\n- This covers the poetry folks\\' \"universal lock\" approach as I understand it: they would put an extremely broad (or perhaps empty) set of specifiers in (1); echo dependency dist specifiers to the dependency lines via (2) and hopefully detect places where that would leave a platform the user cares about broken and emit more copies of the dist requirement via (3) for those situations.\\n- The `mousebender` approach would be emitting multiple lockfiles with tight specifiers in (1) while not really emitting per-dist specifiers in (2) or multiple dists in (3) and relying on environment creators to implement (4) or autodetect (4).\\n- Something like pipenv blends the difference - its lockfiles specify a python requirement at the top, as in (1), and then platform requirements for individual dists throughout as in (2).\\n\\nThis also gives space via (3) to implement something that people often request of poetry, pipenv, and other environment creators of having a local-edit mode for specific dependencies, which is quite useful in a monorepo environment. Say you have a monorepo in which multiple packages are developed independently (in python terms - separate packages, separate `pyproject.toml`s) but depend on each other. When you distribute package A, you want its metadata to require some version-specifier of package B. When you\\'re doing local development, you really want the environment you use to have B installed editably with whatever version you see. Here, with the addition of some supplemental marker, you\\'d be able to have your cake and eat it too.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ncharliermarsh | 2024-02-24 14:00:45 UTC | #64\\n\\n[quote=\"Paul Moore, post:57, topic:46593, username:pf_moore\"]\\nThis came up in the previous lockfile discussion, where an important idea was that installing a lockfile should be possible *without* needing a resolver.

Before I forget I would like to note two things that resolvers could experiment with:\\n\\n- For such resolvers that choose to use target triples it would be awesome to copy what Zig does and allow appending a specific version of glibc for Linux e.g. `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.X.Y` which then could be translated appropriately to manylinux tags that would be locked.\\n- Resolvers could come up with their own UX for overrides e.g. a particular dependency at a particular version should use a particular fork in Git. Projects such as PDM, UV, and Poetry already have such configuration so they would not have to change or adopt any standardized config that they may deem inferior to their ideas.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ngroodt | 2024-02-24 18:59:11 UTC | #88\\n\\nThe way Im now thinking about this proposal is that it replaces the pip-tools style of locked requirements.txt. It improves on them because it addresses some shortcomings in that it can support multiple environments and has more useful metadata. \\n\\nIt would also be a more robust replacement for anyone using “pip freeze” as a mechanism to reproduce an environment.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nradoering | 2024-02-24 19:16:34 UTC | #89\\n\\n[quote=\"Paul Moore, post:84, topic:46593, username:pf_moore\"]\\n… and you have no interest in submitting the poetry format for standardisation, to avoid having to support 2 formats?\\n[/quote]\\n\\nGood question. I haven\\'t thought about it yet.\\n\\nThe first question is: Should I propose the current format, which requires re-resolving, or should I propose what I described as \"my vision\"? Standardizing the current format makes the transition to \"my vision\" more difficult so I probably wouldn\\'t want it to be a standard. Since \"my vision\" cannot be written by any tool at the moment and I only believe it is (not sure it really is) possible for Poetry, it may turn out that it is impractical for any resolver to create this format. That\\'s neither a good starting point for standardization.\\n\\nFurther, only universal/environment-independent resolvers will be able to create such a format. I don\\'t think that resolvers that solve for a specific environment (afaik pip) will be able to create this format. How shall they calculate resulting marker conditions if they only evaluate marker conditions by inserting values?\\n\\nAll in all, I think it\\'s too early considering my limited resources.\\n\\n[quote=\"Charlie Marsh, post:53, topic:46593, username:charliermarsh\"]\\nGenerate a “universal resolution” (like Poetry), i.e., attempt to generate a “single” resolution that is then re-resolved and narrowed-down at install time based on the current platform.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nIn case uv decides to take this path and is willing to try what I described to make re-resolving unnecessary, they might be earlier in a position to propose such a format as standard.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\npf_moore | 2024-02-24 19:40:25 UTC | #90\\n\\n[quote=\"Randy Döring, post:89, topic:46593, username:radoering\"]\\nAll in all, I think it’s too early considering my limited resources.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nFair enough.

(Late evaluation)\\n\\nThe proposal (eager evaluation) would appear to fail-fast and refuse to produce a lockfile for any target environments that it wouldn’t be possible to install into at some later point. It gives you stronger guarantees in some sense. For example, if you know you are targeting some “cloud lambda” runtime, and you produce a lockfile for some “cloud lambda” runtime ahead of time, you can broadly send the lockfile to “cloud lambda” runtime and it could fetch and install and run (ignoring a whole suite of sdist or network issues) and you’d have greater guarantees it would work.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ncemici | 2024-02-24 20:25:58 UTC | #92\\n\\nAnd the way in which the current proposal does not work for that use case is that it requires the resolver to enumerate a combinatorially large number of possible environments in the lock file.\\n\\neg consider the `build` example from earlier: among other things its [requirements](https://github.com/pypa/build/blob/9ceb49db39d81d5e7efc50a371e4612323fbdb80/pyproject.toml#L40-L42) include:\\n```\\n  \\'colorama; os_name == \"nt\"\\',\\n  \\'importlib-metadata >= 4.6; python_full_version < \"3.10.2\"\\',\\n  \\'tomli >= 1.1.0; python_version < \"3.11\"\\',\\n```\\nwhich already splits python versions into three ranges, and os name into two categories.\\n\\nA \"universal\" lockfile for anything depending on `build` is in a six-way world before it has any other dependencies at all.

At the moment I feel like everyone’s being expected to “just know” what lockfiles are for…\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI agree with both these comments.  To me this seems like the most important thing.  Even if the proposal is separate from any concrete tools, it would be useful to see something like \"The intent is that with this proposal, we can create tools that will allow a user to do X\".\\n\\nAs usual, I actually think that it is important to make a decision on this matter (or at least clarify it somewhat) *before* we get too deep into the discussion of any particular proposal.  There is no point debating the technical details of a proposal unless, at the conceptual level, we think it can support the use cases that users currently feel are lacking.\\n\\nIf I understand right, the main point of contention is whether the lockfile specifies *exactly* what will be installed, or only specifies (as @sirosen called it) a \"boundary\" around what may be installed.  What use cases would push users toward wanting one of these behaviors versus the other?\\n\\nWhen I\\'m thinking about using lock files I\\'m mostly thinking about things like deploying a web app or distributing a desktop app.  The goal is to set up a \"known working\" environment.  From this perspective I feel like a \"strict\" lockfile makes more sense, because if the platform where I\\'m going to install the lockfile differs enough that the package set needs to be adjusted somehow, then it\\'s no longer a known-working environment.\\n\\nIf a lockfile format is created and finds its way into user-facing tools, my hunch is that users are going to be more irritated if the \"install from this lockfile\" operation seems to succeed, but then the software doesn\\'t actually work, than if the install errors out even though it actually could have worked (e.g., by ignoring certain constraints).  In the latter case, there is always the fallback of trying to do a \"regular\" install (i.e., with install-time resolving).  That again suggests to me that it makes more sense to err on the side of strictness, and prefer false-negatives (\"this says it won\\'t work but I can make it work\") to false-positives (\"this says it will work but it doesn\\'t\").\\n\\n[quote=\"Paul Moore, post:47, topic:46593, username:pf_moore\"]\\nSuppose I’m writing an installer, and all I know is that I’m going to be handed a file that conforms to the lockfile standard, that was produced by *some* tool which is supposed to have included at least one lock entry that will work on this environment[1]. How can I use the `marker` and `tag` data as part of my decision process?\\n\\n1: Basically, I’m assuming the user won’t try to install a lock file that they *know* isn’t going to work\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI quoted the footnote here because I think there is a subtle but important difference between what it says and what the main text of your comment says.  In the main text, you\\'re speaking from the perspective of someone writing an installer, and you assume the lockfile you\\'re handed will work on this environment.  But in the footnote it\\'s the user who knows the lockfile won\\'t work.  But these perspectives are quite different.  The beliefs of users about whether the lock file will work is likely to depend on much more than just what tool produced it, and in fact, in many cases the user may have little or no understanding of what tool produced it or how.  Instead they will often be seeing instructions on some project\\'s website that say \"to install this project, type `installfromlockfile mylockfile.lock`\", and it is on that basis that they will believe that it will work.\\n\\nMy point here is just that, although I agree users will probably not try to install a lockfile that *they* know won\\'t work, there may be many cases in which they try to install a lockfile that *we* know won\\'t work (or that the project author or installer author knows won\\'t work).  :slight_smile: I think this is relevant if we think about the robustness or failure modes of the lockfile, along the lines I described above.\\n\\nSo I agree with your point that maybe markers and tags aren\\'t so relevant.  In the end what I see as the point of lockfiles is providing a sort of anchor or lever that allows software authors to provide a greater degree of confidence to software users: \"if you use this tool to install this lockfile, and the operation succeeds, you will get a working version of my software\".  The usefulness of that guarantee depends on the tradeoff between how many caveats it has to have (i.e., does the user have to use a specific install tool, what happens if the operation fails) and how much can be guaranteed, and I think we should have that tradeoff in mind when thinking about the design.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\ngroodt | 2024-02-24 20:56:33 UTC | #96\\n\\n[quote=\"Cemici, post:94, topic:46593, username:cemici\"]\\nsure, but that is saying the same thing from the other end.

Let me try and turn that into something that\\'s as specific as I\\'d like.\\n\\nI\\'m writing some code in Python, and in order to run it, I need a number of libraries. For my development, I\\'m using a `requirements.txt` file to install the libraries into a virtual environment, but I don\\'t fix the versions of my dependencies - as long as my code works, I\\'m good.\\n\\nNow, I want to share my code with my colleagues. In order to ensure they get the same results that I get, I want to make sure they are using the same software that I\\'m using, so I feed my `requirements.txt` file into a \"locker\" which spits out a Python lock file. I can now share my scripts, plus that lock file, and my colleagues can use an installer to create an environment containing exactly the same software as I have been using, and do their own analysis and get the same results.\\n\\n(I\\'ll note at this point that this use case implies that I want my colleagues to use the same *Python* version as me, as well. I\\'m not sure I can think of a realistic scenario where I\\'d care about them using the same versions of my dependencies, but not use the same Python version).\\n\\nBrett\\'s proposal seems to cover this case just fine.\\n\\nNow let\\'s suppose that one of my colleagues is using a Mac, and I\\'m using Windows. OK, that *might* be an issue. I don\\'t have access to a Mac. Luckily, though, my locker allows me to say `lock --platform=mac` and it creates a lock file for the Mac.\\n\\nThis is *still* supported by Brett\\'s proposal, assuming that cross-platform resolving is possible. The *locker* needs to be able to resolve for a Mac while running on a Windows system. And that\\'s certainly possible (with the usual caveats about sdists and build-time code execution), because you can construct your own marker and tag set, and run a resolve using that. But it\\'s just a problem for the locker, not for any other part of the chain.\\n\\nI\\'m still not seeing why it\\'s of any advantage to leave the target computer to do the resolve here.\\n\\n[quote=\"Greg Roodt, post:91, topic:46593, username:groodt\"]\\nThe proposal (eager evaluation) would appear to fail-fast and refuse to produce a lockfile for an environment that wouldn’t be possible to install at some later point.

Isn\\'t the whole *point* to be able to know that you can send the lockfile to the target environment and be sure that it will run? That\\'s *why* you want to precompute the exact wheels (or sdists if you must) that you want the target to download and install. If you\\'re not doing that, why not just send a requirements file (or a standardised equivalent)?\\n\\nNote that I\\'m very definitely *not* seeing lockfiles as just \"standardised reqirements files\", and if anyone is thinking that, then we have a very different understanding of what locking is - after all, this is a perfectly valid requirements file:\\n\\n```\\nrich\\nclick >= 7.0\\n```\\n\\nBut there\\'s no way I\\'d consider that as a \"lock file\"!\\n\\nI\\'m really not seeing why people are insisting that there\\'s a need for the *installer* to do a second resolve here.

I\\'m trying to understand the problem you\\'re describing, because I don\\'t want to end up approving a standard that doesn\\'t address the needs people have.

So what you\\'re saying is that you want to be able to request a lockfile that\\'s intended to be usable on *any* platform, without needing to explicitly state what platforms you\\'re targetting? OK, I can see that would be an problematic situation - as you say, it\\'s a combinatorial explosion.\\n\\nBut is it realistic? If, as @ofek suggested, lockers default to supporting the major platforms, and you cover a sensible set of python versions (at worst, 5 versions if you limit yourself to supported minor versions, 2 if you omit security fix only releases), then it\\'s entirely manageable. And I\\'m still struggling to think of a scenario where I\\'d use a lockfile and I *couldn\\'t* say something like \"you need to use the same Python version as I used\", so that\\'s just *one* Python version. And in my scenario, as I described it above, adding a new lock target when people ask for an additional platform to be supported seems like it\\'s *also* a perfectly fair way of handling that situation.\\n\\nYour \"universal\" lockfile sounds more like a base set of requirements, combined with some form of \"snapshot\" of the state of the relevant package index(es) to me. Which is an interesting, and potentially useful, idea - but not at all what I\\'d describe as \"locking\".\\n\\nBut the point here isn\\'t to make judgements on scenarios as described. Thank you (and Greg) for the explanation of the scenario.

The file format is TOML.\\n\\nThe allowed keys in the file are listed below (all keys are required unless specified as optional). A TOML file with this also written out can be found at https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.spec.toml . Examples of lock files are listed later on.\\n\\nAnything w/ a 🔥 means it\\'s a contentious key.\\n\\n## `meta`\\nMetadata version of the file; initially \"1.0\". Since this file is designed to be human-readable but machine-writable, versioning the metadata makes sense as we don\\'t need to keep a backwards-compatible format for humans to directly work with and instead need a way to help tools migrate to newer metadata versions.\\n\\n## `indexes` 🔥\\nAn array of URLs to package indexes to use to find distributions. Recorded in most- to least-preferred order. Recording the indexes used helps when adding new lock entries by making the potential distributions consistent.\\n\\n## `dependencies`\\nArray of top-level dependency specifiers. This acts as the input of what to resolve for, so all details are to be included (e.g. extras, markers, etc.).\\n\\n## `[[lock]]`\\nA lock entry for an environment.\\n\\n## `lock.markers` 🔥\\nA table of environment markers used to produce the lock entry.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/resolve-markers-tags-requirements is an alternative that uses a list of relevant markers.\\n\\n## `lock.tags` 🔥\\nAn array of wheel tags supported by the environment as used to produce the lock entry. The tags are sorted from most- to least-preferred.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/resolve-markers-tags-requirements is an alternative that only lists the required wheel tag sets.\\n\\n## `[[lock.wheel]]`\\nA wheel file for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.name`\\nThe distribution\\'s normalized name. You cannot solely rely on the wheel filename to calculate this as the file name may not be a valid `.whl` file name due to [direct references](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#direct-references) (technically a tool could download the arbitrary URL and inspect it to determine the wheel file details if one so desired). Having the name as a distinct key also has the benefit that its easier to read than from a wheel file name.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.filename`\\nThe file\\'s name.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.origin`\\nA URL or file path (via `file://`) where the wheel that was locked against was found. The location does not need to exist in the future, so this should be treated as only a hint to where to look and/or recording where the wheel file originally came from.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.hashes`\\nA table of file hashes; algorithm:value pairs. This makes sure that one is getting the wheel file that was locked against for reproducibility and security purposes.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.direct`\\nWhether `origin` is the direct URL in terms of [`direct_url.json`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url/).\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.requires-python`\\nPython version requirement (optional). If an installer chooses to determine environment compatibility that is not as strict as an exact match of `lock.markers` and `lock.tags`, knowing the supporting Python versions is important to determine if this wheel file is compatible as this is not necessarily communicated via the wheel file name itself.\\n\\n## `lock.wheel.dependencies`\\nA list of normalized distribution names which this distribution depends on (optional). Viewing the overall lock entry as the entire worldview of distributions available, each entry can be just the distribution name (a perk of Python not allowing multiple distribution versions simultaneously). This allows for introspection as to why a distribution is included in the lock entry (i.e. calculate the dependency graph between distributions). Details like extras and markers are not necessary as the resolver has already handled them.\\n\\nBecause this is not required to have a successful install, it is considered optional.\\n\\n## `[[lock.sdist]]`\\nA source distribution file for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.name`\\nSee `lock.wheel.name`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.filename`\\nSee `lock.wheel.filename`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.origin`\\nSee `lock.wheel.origin`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.hashes`\\nSee `lock.wheel.hashes`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.direct`\\nSee `lock.wheel.direct`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.requires-python`\\nSee `lock.wheel.requires-python`.\\n\\n## `lock.sdist.dependencies`\\nSee `lock.wheel.dependencies` for what is recorded in this array (optional). The contents may come from either:\\n- `PKG-INFO` if `Metadata-Version` is 2.2 or higher and the appropriate fields are not `Dynamic`.\\n- From building the sdist.\\n- Etc.\\n\\n## `[[lock.sdist.build-requires]]`\\nAn array of files that *can* be used or *were* used to build the sdist based on [`build-system.requires` from `pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#declaring-build-system-dependencies-the-build-system-table) (optional). The acceptable keys are `wheel` and `sdist` and their values match what is acceptable under the same name directly under `[[lock]]`. Any future expansion of acceptable distribution types under `[[lock]]` will also be supported here.\\n\\nThis effectively makes the table a self-contained lock entry just for this sdist with `build-system.requires` providing the value for `dependencies`.\\n\\nIt absent, it is at the installer\\'s discretion how to go about building the sdist (including refusing to).\\n\\n## `[[lock.git]]`\\nA Git repository of source code for the lock entry (optional).\\n\\n## `lock.git.name`\\nSee `lock.wheel.name`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.repo`\\nA URL to the Git repository; it may be a `file://` path.\\n\\n## `lock.git.commit`\\nThe commit of the repository to use. It should be a specific commit and not a tag or branch as those can change.\\n\\n## `lock.git.direct`\\nSee `lock.wheel.direct`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.requires-python`\\nSee `lock.wheel.requires-python`.\\n\\n## `lock.git.dependencies`\\nSee `lock.wheel.dependencies` for what is recorded in this array (optional). The contents may come from:\\n- `pyproject.toml` if `project.dependencies` (and `project.optional-dependencies` as appropriate) exists and is not `dynamic`.\\n- From building the repository based on its `pyproject.toml` file.\\n- Etc.\\n\\n## `[[lock.git.build-requires]]`\\nSee `lock.sdist.build-requires` (optional).\\n\\n## `[tool]`\\nSame as `pyproject.toml` (optional).\\n\\n# Examples\\n\\n- [A lock file with entries for multiple environments](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.compatibility-example.toml).\\n- [A larger lock file](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.graph-example.toml) w/ accompanying [dependency graph of the lock file](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/pylock.graph-example.md).\\n\\n# Proof of Concept\\nThe [`resolve` branch of my mousebender project](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/resolve) has a wheels-only, requires-PyPI-[PEP-714](https://peps.python.org/pep-0714/)-metadata lock generation tool (the restrictions are because I only have so much time and we now have alternative installers showing up, so I don\\'t need to aim for completeness). You can look at the [shell script that I use to generate the examples](https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/blob/resolve/update-examples.sh) listed above to see how to play with it. The `install` subcommand doesn\\'t do anything but list out the wheel filenames that would be installed since installation isn\\'t interesting thanks to the \\'installer` project and the only decision at install time is which lock entry to use.\\n\\nThe key point, though, is I was able to write a proof-of-concept that produces and consumes lock files based on this spec.\\n\\n# PEP 665 Comparison\\nThe most obvious difference is the inclusion of sdists from the start. 😁 But that was facilitated by making each distribution file type their own concept which is also different. The concept of lock entries is also different.'],\n",

It seems pretty straightforward, but there are a couple of places where I had some questions.\\n\\n1. The installation report doesn\\'t record the wheel tags pip used, so I can\\'t populate the `lock.tags` array. The spec says this is optional, so I assume this isn\\'t technically an issue. A missing (which I assume is the same as \"empty\") tag set in the lockfile is compatible with any environment, so it\\'s simply up to the user not to use the lockfile in an inappropriate environment, which I think is fine.\\n2. I have to use the filename from the URL to determine if the entry file is a wheel or not. I don\\'t think that\\'s a major issue, but it does make the whole \"wheel vs sdist\" split feel a little artificial. The PEP should probably include a rationale for why it\\'s important to have separate `wheel` and `sdist` tables^[beyond \"everyone got up tight last time about sdists, so I wanted to keep them separate :slightly_smiling_face:].\\n3. Pip doesn\\'t record build environment details, so I have to omit `lock.sdist.build-requires`. I assume this would mean \"installers should use their default mechanism for creating a build environment, and so can\\'t guarantee reproducibility\", and I think that\\'s fine. Is that your expectation?\\n\\nI also note that the `lock.git` type doesn\\'t include a `build-requires` section. I assume it should, as a git repository contains source.\\n\\nAlso, while I see the practical reasons for having a specific \"git\" lock entry file type, I can see people pushing back on git getting \"special treatment\". Maybe the PEP should describe this in terms of general support for VCS file types, with git being the only one defined in this iteration of the spec, but additional VCS types can be added in future spec versions as needed. That doesn\\'t need to be anything more than a general statement that `[[lock.OTHER-VCS-NAME]]` is reserved for future use, at this point.'],\n",

I will have to think about it more but have a couple small points:\\n\\nLike @sethmlarson I'm a bit concerned about the hashes being based on the raw text of the file.  It means that formatting distinctions which are semantically meaningless in TOML (such as whitespace or the use of different string delimiters) will affect the hash.\\n\\nNotably, the hash itself relies on one such formatting distinction: it is specified that it must be an *inline* table.  This makes me a bit nervous as it seems like an obvious pitfall for machine-writing.  It looks like the POC implementation doesn't use any TOML-writer lib but rather a textual template into which values are placed.  That is okay for the POC, but in real life, if we expect this file format to be consumed and written by programs, a lot of those programs are going to want to just use a TOML-writing library.  As far as I can see, `toml` (the main TOML lib I see on PyPI) doesn't have any support for stipulating that a particular table be output as inline.\\n\\nIt seems like the spec would be more robust if it could be described purely in terms of the semantic units of TOML (e.g., keys and values), without requiring a layer of special format handling (on input or output).\\n\\nMy other comment is that it would be helpful to have an example lockfile that includes sdists, since including sdists was the impetus for this proposal.

The two are closely tied together, though - should lockers write lock entries that are precisely targeted at very specific environments (marker + tag combinations), or ones that are as widely applicable as possible? Broad lock entries won\\'t be installable *anywhere* by an installer that insists on a strict/exact match^[Because a broad spec is by definition not an exact match], but tight ones could easily not be installable in environments where they would work perfectly well.\\n\\nFrom a producer\\'s point of view, the situation is:\\n\\n* For markers, it\\'s easy to write a precise specification, you just dump out the environment you used when evaluating specifiers for the resolve. That\\'s very precise, and quite probably includes data that\\'s strictly not needed (if the specifiers have no markers, the whole environment is irrelevant), but it\\'s easy to produce. To write *just* the relevant environment values requires the locker to parse the markers, which is complex and currently not available as library code. There would have to be a strong need to justify doing that.\\n* For tags, dumping out the valid tag set for the resolve environment is also easy^[Typically - I have a problem doing this, but that\\'s an oddity of the source data I\\'m using]. But again, it\\'s over-specified, and worse, if you don\\'t have access to an interpreter running in the target environment, it\\'s impossible to calculate in a deterministic way (there\\'s no standard for what\\'s in a system tag set, so even if you *do* have access to the target interpreter, the best you can do is produce \"what the `packaging` library returns\"). In this case, though, it\\'s relatively easy to build a \"minimal\" tag set - just parse the supported tag sets for all the wheels in the solve, and the minimal set is the union of those. Although now that I think about it, because tag sets are ordered, set union isn\\'t actually sufficient - but I can\\'t think of a place where ordering would be needed by a lockfile installer (which shouldn\\'t be doing any resolving) so it\\'s probably \"good enough\".\\n\\nI don\\'t want to derail this attempt at getting lockfiles by digging too deeply into the weeds of \"what it means to define a compatible environment\" but I think we do need to make sure that whatever\\'s in the spec is something that can be implemented in a practical way by both producers and consumers.\\n\\nFrom the feedback from the poetry folks here, it sounds like their approach is different, so I don\\'t know if their insights (beyond \"don\\'t do it that way\" :wink:) will be applicable. But even if the proposal here is not what they do, practical experience is very valuable in any form. It would also be useful to hear from PDM as to how they addressed this issue.

I guess we can\\'t stop them, but we run the risk of ending up with installers and lockers being tightly coupled because they have a shared, but idiosyncratic, idea of what \"compatibility\" means. That doesn\\'t feel like a good outcome. Maybe I\\'ve been wearing my \"interoperability\" hat for too long, but I feel like a lockfile standard that doesn\\'t ensure that users can pick which locker and which installer to use independently, hasn\\'t done its job (after all, that\\'s what we have now - lock files tied to specific tool implementations).\\n\\nDetermining the best valid lock entry to use is up to the consumer. I think that\\'s fine. The producer\\'s job is just to provide a list of lock entries that work, not to judge the trade-offs for the target environment.\\n\\nBut with the above context, I\\'m not actually seeing the benefit of having the \"marker\" and \"tags\" values in an entry. They are (possibly) useful information, but beyond that I\\'m not sure. Put it this way. Suppose I\\'m writing an installer, and all I know is that I\\'m going to be handed a file that conforms to the lockfile standard, that was produced by *some* tool which is supposed to have included at least one lock entry that will work on this environment^[Basically, I\\'m assuming the user won\\'t try to install a lock file that they *know* isn\\'t going to work]. How can I use the `marker` and `tag` data as part of my decision process?\\n\\nThis isn\\'t hypothetical. Pip will need to install lockfiles, I imagine, and we\\'ll need to support a command line like `pip install --target staging_dir --platform manylinux_2_17 --lockfile xxx`. We won\\'t know who produced the lockfile, or what platform they were on when the locker ran, all we\\'ll know is that *somewhere* in that lockfile there\\'s a lock entry that the user believes is valid for the target platform. We won\\'t be able to build a `markers` mapping for a foreign environment, and our supported tag array is built using our own implementation, which could be subtly different than the one the locker used.

You can be very clear and know upfront what will be installed without any work with this proposal; you\\'re _locked_ into what would be installed. Poetry\\'s lock files, though, are more of a subset of the world at the time of locking where you still need to figure out what files apply to you at install time. To me that isn\\'t locking _files_ as much as locking a _subset_ of files that _may_ apply to you, but you won\\'t know until you run an installer.

When you lock for a set of requirements they are recorded in `dependencies`, so whatever extras you have in there are what you are locking for.

For instance, \\n- This covers the poetry folks\\' \"universal lock\" approach as I understand it: they would put an extremely broad (or perhaps empty) set of specifiers in (1); echo dependency dist specifiers to the dependency lines via (2) and hopefully detect places where that would leave a platform the user cares about broken and emit more copies of the dist requirement via (3) for those situations.\\n- The `mousebender` approach would be emitting multiple lockfiles with tight specifiers in (1) while not really emitting per-dist specifiers in (2) or multiple dists in (3) and relying on environment creators to implement (4) or autodetect (4).\\n- Something like pipenv blends the difference - its lockfiles specify a python requirement at the top, as in (1), and then platform requirements for individual dists throughout as in (2).\\n\\nThis also gives space via (3) to implement something that people often request of poetry, pipenv, and other environment creators of having a local-edit mode for specific dependencies, which is quite useful in a monorepo environment.

We don\\'t need a new standard for that. The difference, IMO, is that a lockfile references specific downloadable files, and those files can be checked for validity using hashes included in the lockfile. I\\'m not demanding reproducible installs here (that\\'s what killed the last proposal, as sdist builds aren\\'t reproducible) but I do think that being able to validate in advance what artefacts will be installed is a key point.\\n\\n[quote=\"Charlie Marsh, post:64, topic:46593, username:charliermarsh\"]\\nI’m definitely not advocating for Poetry’s lock file format, but is it so dissimilar?

And I remain sympathetic to the idea that a \"just install these files\" style of locking, like this proposal, is a valid and useful thing to want.

And that you consider the \"here\\'s a list of distribution files - go and resolve the stated requirements using only what\\'s on this list\" approach as out of scope. I\\'m happy to support that position, on the understanding that:\\n\\n1. You explicitly describe in the PEP the two models, and you clearly state which one your proposal is addressing.\\n2. You come up with some formal terminology to distinguish the two cases. I\\'m not so naive as to think that we\\'ll stop people calling them both \"lockfiles\" but I want the PEP at least to address the question of \"how do we talk about this\" precisely.\\n\\nIf someone wants to propose a \"list the files you apply a resolver to\" specification, I\\'ll happily consider that as an independent proposal. I\\'m not ecstatic about having two separate standards here, but I don\\'t want this work to fail yet again because we\\'re talking about multiple different things and never getting consensus or clarity as a result. Also, if someone has an idea for a \"merged\" approach which somehow addresses both models, please speak up! But be prepared for pushback - I\\'m pretty certain that trying to reconcile these two different views is what\\'s caused all of the previous proposals to fail.\\n\\n@charliermarsh - thanks for pushing this question.

At the moment I feel like everyone’s being expected to “just know” what lockfiles are for…\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI agree with both these comments.  To me this seems like the most important thing.  Even if the proposal is separate from any concrete tools, it would be useful to see something like \"The intent is that with this proposal, we can create tools that will allow a user to do X\".\\n\\nAs usual, I actually think that it is important to make a decision on this matter (or at least clarify it somewhat) *before* we get too deep into the discussion of any particular proposal.  There is no point debating the technical details of a proposal unless, at the conceptual level, we think it can support the use cases that users currently feel are lacking.\\n\\nIf I understand right, the main point of contention is whether the lockfile specifies *exactly* what will be installed, or only specifies (as @sirosen called it) a \"boundary\" around what may be installed.  What use cases would push users toward wanting one of these behaviors versus the other?\\n\\nWhen I\\'m thinking about using lock files I\\'m mostly thinking about things like deploying a web app or distributing a desktop app.  The goal is to set up a \"known working\" environment.  From this perspective I feel like a \"strict\" lockfile makes more sense, because if the platform where I\\'m going to install the lockfile differs enough that the package set needs to be adjusted somehow, then it\\'s no longer a known-working environment.\\n\\nIf a lockfile format is created and finds its way into user-facing tools, my hunch is that users are going to be more irritated if the \"install from this lockfile\" operation seems to succeed, but then the software doesn\\'t actually work, than if the install errors out even though it actually could have worked (e.g., by ignoring certain constraints).  In the latter case, there is always the fallback of trying to do a \"regular\" install (i.e., with install-time resolving).  That again suggests to me that it makes more sense to err on the side of strictness, and prefer false-negatives (\"this says it won\\'t work but I can make it work\") to false-positives (\"this says it will work but it doesn\\'t\").\\n\\n[quote=\"Paul Moore, post:47, topic:46593, username:pf_moore\"]\\nSuppose I’m writing an installer, and all I know is that I’m going to be handed a file that conforms to the lockfile standard, that was produced by *some* tool which is supposed to have included at least one lock entry that will work on this environment[1]. How can I use the `marker` and `tag` data as part of my decision process?\\n\\n1: Basically, I’m assuming the user won’t try to install a lock file that they *know* isn’t going to work\\n[/quote]\\n\\nI quoted the footnote here because I think there is a subtle but important difference between what it says and what the main text of your comment says.  In the main text, you\\'re speaking from the perspective of someone writing an installer, and you assume the lockfile you\\'re handed will work on this environment.  But in the footnote it\\'s the user who knows the lockfile won\\'t work.  But these perspectives are quite different.  The beliefs of users about whether the lock file will work is likely to depend on much more than just what tool produced it, and in fact, in many cases the user may have little or no understanding of what tool produced it or how.  Instead they will often be seeing instructions on some project\\'s website that say \"to install this project, type `installfromlockfile mylockfile.lock`\", and it is on that basis that they will believe that it will work.\\n\\nMy point here is just that, although I agree users will probably not try to install a lockfile that *they* know won\\'t work, there may be many cases in which they try to install a lockfile that *we* know won\\'t work (or that the project author or installer author knows won\\'t work).  :slight_smile: I think this is relevant if we think about the robustness or failure modes of the lockfile, along the lines I described above.\\n\\nSo I agree with your point that maybe markers and tags aren\\'t so relevant.  In the end what I see as the point of lockfiles is providing a sort of anchor or lever that allows software authors to provide a greater degree of confidence to software users: \"if you use this tool to install this lockfile, and the operation succeeds, you will get a working version of my software\".  The usefulness of that guarantee depends on the tradeoff between how many caveats it has to have (i.e., does the user have to use a specific install tool, what happens if the operation fails) and how much can be guaranteed, and I think we should have that tradeoff in mind when thinking about the design.'],\n",

Let me try and turn that into something that\\'s as specific as I\\'d like.\\n\\nI\\'m writing some code in Python, and in order to run it, I need a number of libraries. For my development, I\\'m using a `requirements.txt` file to install the libraries into a virtual environment, but I don\\'t fix the versions of my dependencies - as long as my code works, I\\'m good.\\n\\nNow, I want to share my code with my colleagues. In order to ensure they get the same results that I get, I want to make sure they are using the same software that I\\'m using, so I feed my `requirements.txt` file into a \"locker\" which spits out a Python lock file. I can now share my scripts, plus that lock file, and my colleagues can use an installer to create an environment containing exactly the same software as I have been using, and do their own analysis and get the same results.\\n\\n(I\\'ll note at this point that this use case implies that I want my colleagues to use the same *Python* version as me, as well. I\\'m not sure I can think of a realistic scenario where I\\'d care about them using the same versions of my dependencies, but not use the same Python version).\\n\\nBrett\\'s proposal seems to cover this case just fine.\\n\\nNow let\\'s suppose that one of my colleagues is using a Mac, and I\\'m using Windows. OK, that *might* be an issue. I don\\'t have access to a Mac. Luckily, though, my locker allows me to say `lock --platform=mac` and it creates a lock file for the Mac.\\n\\nThis is *still* supported by Brett\\'s proposal, assuming that cross-platform resolving is possible. The *locker* needs to be able to resolve for a Mac while running on a Windows system. And that\\'s certainly possible (with the usual caveats about sdists and build-time code execution), because you can construct your own marker and tag set, and run a resolve using that. But it\\'s just a problem for the locker, not for any other part of the chain.\\n\\nI\\'m still not seeing why it\\'s of any advantage to leave the target computer to do the resolve here.\\n\\n[quote=\"Greg Roodt, post:91, topic:46593, username:groodt\"]\\nThe proposal (eager evaluation) would appear to fail-fast and refuse to produce a lockfile for an environment that wouldn’t be possible to install at some later point.

Isn\\'t the whole *point* to be able to know that you can send the lockfile to the target environment and be sure that it will run? That\\'s *why* you want to precompute the exact wheels (or sdists if you must) that you want the target to download and install. If you\\'re not doing that, why not just send a requirements file (or a standardised equivalent)?\\n\\nNote that I\\'m very definitely *not* seeing lockfiles as just \"standardised reqirements files\", and if anyone is thinking that, then we have a very different understanding of what locking is - after all, this is a perfectly valid requirements file:\\n\\n```\\nrich\\nclick >= 7.0\\n```\\n\\nBut there\\'s no way I\\'d consider that as a \"lock file\"!\\n\\nI\\'m really not seeing why people are insisting that there\\'s a need for the *installer* to do a second resolve here.

If it\\'s not, then what benefit *is* using a lockfile giving (over a requirements file^[insert \"or a standardised equivalent\" boilerplate here], to be concrete)?\\n\\nI\\'m sorry if I\\'m being particularly dense here. I\\'m trying to understand the problem you\\'re describing, because I don\\'t want to end up approving a standard that doesn\\'t address the needs people have. But I\\'m not going to reject the proposal based on a scenario that no-one can describe clearly enough to show where the proposal fails!\\n\\n[quote=\"Cemici, post:92, topic:46593, username:cemici\"]\\nAnd the way in which the current proposal does not work for that use case is that it requires the resolver to enumerate a combinatorially large number of possible environments in the lock file.\\n[/quote]\\n\\nThank you for being explicit. So what you\\'re saying is that you want to be able to request a lockfile that\\'s intended to be usable on *any* platform, without needing to explicitly state what platforms you\\'re targetting? OK, I can see that would be an problematic situation - as you say, it\\'s a combinatorial explosion.\\n\\nBut is it realistic? If, as @ofek suggested, lockers default to supporting the major platforms, and you cover a sensible set of python versions (at worst, 5 versions if you limit yourself to supported minor versions, 2 if you omit security fix only releases), then it\\'s entirely manageable. And I\\'m still struggling to think of a scenario where I\\'d use a lockfile and I *couldn\\'t* say something like \"you need to use the same Python version as I used\", so that\\'s just *one* Python version. And in my scenario, as I described it above, adding a new lock target when people ask for an additional platform to be supported seems like it\\'s *also* a perfectly fair way of handling that situation.\\n\\nYour \"universal\" lockfile sounds more like a base set of requirements, combined with some form of \"snapshot\" of the state of the relevant package index(es) to me. Which is an interesting, and potentially useful, idea - but not at all what I\\'d describe as \"locking\".\\n\\nBut the point here isn\\'t to make judgements on scenarios as described. Thank you (and Greg) for the explanation of the scenario. I think Brett has already said he plans on considering this model out of scope, and based on what I\\'ve seen here that seems like a fair decision to me.
